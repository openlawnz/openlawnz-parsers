____________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
REASONS 
[1] Forivermor  Ltd, a  company  owned by Mr and Mrs Morley,  applies for leave 
to  appeal  against  a  judgment  of  the  Court  of Appeal1 dismissing  its  appeal  against 
the  rejection  by  the  High  Court2 of  its  claim  for  damages  against ANZ  Bank  New 
Zealand Limited. 
[2] The  background  is  that,  in August  2008,  the  applicant  sought  funding  from 
the  respondent  to  finance  the  purchase  of  a  farm  adjacent  to  one  which  Forivermor 
already owned.  The purchase price for the land and associated Fonterra  shares was 
                                                 1  Forivermor Ltd v ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd [2014] NZCA 129. 2  Forivermor Ltd v ANZ National Bank Ltd [2012] NZHC 1763.   $7,298,928 plus GST.  The Bank agreed to advance to the applicant $2,167,000 plus 
bridging  finance,  which  would  cover  the  deposit.    Morley  family interests  were  to 
contribute  one  million  dollars.    Forivermor's  proposal  also  required  Forivermor  to 
contribute  $4,300,000  from  the  planned  sale  of  a  57ha  part  of  its  existing  farm.  
Settlement of the purchase was to take place in May 2009. 
[3] Discussions  took  place  between  the  Morleys,  their  solicitor  and  the  Bank, 
over  whether  the  Bank  would  cover  the  applicant  if  its  land  did  not  sell  in  time,  or 
for enough.  The applicant then committed itself to an unconditional contract for the 
purchase.  Prior to settlement market prices for dairy farms fell and the applicant was 
unable to sell part of its existing farm, as it had envisaged.  Eventually the applicant 
sold  the  whole  farm  for  $3,300,000.    This  price  necessitated  further  loan  financing 
for  the  purchase.   The  Bank,  however,  refused  to  provide  it.   The  applicant  did  not 
settle the purchase and the vendors cancelled the contract. 
[4] The  applicant  sued  the  Bank.    Its  causes  of  action  were  breach  of  contract, 
misrepresentation,  breach  of  contract  based  on  the  Code  of  Banking  Practice, 
negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of the Fair Trading Act 1986 and breach 
of  the  Consumer  Guarantees Act  1993.    The  central  theme  of  the  applicant's  case 
was  that,  prior  to  the  applicant  making  its  contract  to  purchase  the  new  farm 
unconditional,  the  Bank  had  warranted  that  it  would  provide  funding  to  the  full 
extent  required  to  complete  the  purchase,  whether  or  not  the  applicant  was  able  to 
sell  the  57ha  of  its  farm  by  settlement.    Subsidiary  contentions  included  claims  by 
the applicant that the Bank had advised and encouraged it to enter into the agreement 
to buy the farm, including suggesting the purchase.   
[5] In  its  application  for  leave,  the  applicant  contends  that  the  proposed  appeal 
raises  issues  of  public  importance  or  general  commercial  significance  in  relation  to 
the  legal  status  of  the  NZ  Code  of  Banking  Practice.   A  particular  issue  would  be 
whether, as a matter of bank trading practice and custom, the terms of the Code had 
been  incorporated  into  the  finance  contract  entered  into  with  the  applicant.    It  also 
contends  that  the  legal  effect  of  standards  for  lending  practices,  promulgated  to 
customers  by  the  Bank,  and  other  banks,  raises  questions  of  general  commercial 
significance because of the predominant position of banks in relation to customers.     [6] The  main  difficulty  for  the  applicant  in  its  application  for  leave  to  appeal  to 
this  Court  is  that  both  Courts  below  have  rejected  the  factual  contentions  that  are 
central  to  the  applicant's  claims.   The  Court  of Appeal  found  that  the  Bank's  loan 
offer was accepted by the applicant on its terms, not subject to any oral amendment 
or assurance.3  This made the Bank's obligation dependent on the applicant making 
the  contribution  specified  in  its  proposal.    Findings  of  fact  adverse  to  the  applicant 
were  also  made  in  respect  of  discussions  between  the  Bank's  officers  and  the 
solicitor acting for the applicant during the period between the Bank making its offer 
and the applicant making the contract unconditional.4   
[7] We  are  satisfied that  this  proceeding  was  effectively  determined  by  the 
findings  of  fact  in  both  Courts  against  the  applicant.    The  Court  is  not  prepared  to 
revisit  those  concurrent  findings.   There  is  accordingly  no  sound  basis  for  the  legal 
grounds which the applicant wishes to address. 
[8] Accordingly  we  are  not  satisfied  that  it  is  in  the  interests  of  justice  to  grant 
the application for leave to appeal and the application is dismissed.
