Introduction 
[1] The  appellants,  Mr  Morgenstern  and  his  partner  Ms  Lavas,  appeal  against  a 
judgment  of  the  High  Court  finding  Mr  Morgenstern  in  breach  of  his  duties  as  a 
director  under  ss 131,  135  and  137  of  the  Companies  Act  1993  (the  Act)  and   ordering him to pay the sum of $3,499,999 to Kingdon Undertaking Ltd, previously 
Morning Star Enterprises Ltd (in liq)) (MSE) under s 301 of the Act and costs.1 
[2] The  respondents  Ms  Jeffreys  and  Mr  Downes,  are  the  liquidators  of  MSE, 
Kingdon  Development  Ltd  (KDL)  and  Axon  House  Carparking  Ltd  (previously 
GS &  LD  Lease  Ltd)  (GLL),  all  of  which  were  Auckland  property  development 
companies operated by Mr Morgenstern.  They cross-appeal against the High Court's 
dismissal  of  their  alternative  claim  for  the  judgment  sum  based  on  s  298 of  the Act 
(in law they seek to support the judgment on another ground) and their claim for an 
additional  amount  payable  by  GLL  for  a  monthly  carpark  incentive  fee  ($100,000 
annually) based on ss 135 and 136 of the Act. 
[3] Mr Morgenstern's appeal relates to the sale of his 99 shares in Morning Star 
(St  Lukes  Garden  Apartments)  Ltd (MS  St  Lukes)  to  MSE  on  30 March 2007  for 
$3,465,000 and the sale of the remaining one share held by Ms Lavas to MSE on or 
about 8 May 2007 for $35,000, a total of $3,500,000.  The purpose of the sale was to 
enable Mr Morgenstern, who was the sole shareholder and director of MSE, to repay 
his overdrawn current account with MSE. 
[4] In  the  High  Court  Rodney  Hansen  J  held  that  the  consideration  for  the 
99 shares  of  $3,465,000  was  excessive.2  Further,  he  found  that,  in  authorising  the 
purchase of the shares by MSE for an excessive consideration, Mr Morgenstern was 
in breach of: 
(a) his duty to act in good faith in the best interests of MSE under s 131 
of the Act;3 
(b) his duty not to agree to, cause or allow reckless trading by MSE under 
s 135;4 and 
(c) his duty of care to MSE in his directorial role under s 137.5 
                                                 1  Jeffreys v Morgenstern [2014] NZHC 308 [High Court judgment]. 2  At [96]. 3  At [110]. 4  At [112]. 5  At [116].   [5] On this basis the Judge made an order under s 301(1)(b) of the Act requiring 
Mr Morgenstern to pay $3,499,999 to MSE, being the resultant loss to the company 
from  the  purchase  of  the  shares  less  $1,  being  the  price  at  which  the  shares  were 
subsequently sold to St Lukes Holding Ltd.6 
[6] As  no  relief  was  sought  against  Ms  Lavas,  no  order  was  made  against  her.7  
She  was  not  a  director  and  therefore  not  in  breach  of  any  relevant  duties  under  the 
Act.  Her position therefore does not arise for consideration on this appeal. 
[7] Mr Morgenstern challenges the High Court judgment on the grounds that: 
(a) The  Judge's  finding  that  the  consideration  was  excessive  was 
inconsistent with his decision to dismiss the liquidators' claim under 
s 298  of  the Act  because  the  liquidators  had  failed  to  prove  that  the 
shares were worth less than MSE had paid for them. 
(b) Mr  Morgenstern  had  acted  and  relied  on  professional  advice  in 
authorising MSE to purchase the shares for $3,465,000. 
(c) The consideration of $3,465,000 represented the "fair value" of the 
shares in MS St Lukes as at 30 March 2007. 
(d) Mr Morgenstern honestly believed that the purchase of the shares was 
in the best interests of MSE. 
(e) No  loss  was  caused  to  MSE  by  the  purchase  of  the  shares  on 
30 March 2007.  Any loss was caused by subsequent events. 
[8] As is apparent from these grounds, the principal focus of the appeal is on the 
circumstances surrounding the sale by Mr Morgenstern of his shares in MS St Lukes 
to  MSE  on  30  March  2007,  including  in  particular  the  value  of  the  shares  on  that 
date,  and  the  consequential  application  of  the  relevant  provisions  of  the Act  to  the 
transaction in the light of those circumstances. 
                                                 6  At [120]. 7  At [120].   [9] We address the liquidators' cross-appeals separately.8 
Background 
[10] Mr  Morgenstern,  primarily  through  MSE,  had  been  a  successful  property 
developer in Auckland.9 
The St Lukes development 
[11] For  present  purposes  the  relevant  development  was  being  undertaken  at 
St Lukes, Auckland, by  MS St Lukes.  Mr Morgenstern was the sole director of the 
company. 
[12] St Lukes was a $67,000,000 development (with an anticipated profit in 2004 
of $14,335,000) financed by the  Bank of New  Zealand (the BNZ) as first mortgage 
lender  and  Structured  Finance  (NZ)  Ltd  (Structured  Finance)  as  second  mortgage 
lender. 
[13] The financial side of the development was managed by Mr Martyn Reesby of 
Reesby & Co Ltd.  All payments had to be made or approved by Structured Finance.  
Mr  Reesby  regularly  prepared  financial  reports  and  feasibility  studies  reporting  on 
the projected returns from the development. 
[14] The St Lukes development, which commenced in 2003, involved two stages.  
The  first  stage  was  completed  in  2005  with  the  construction  of  241  apartments  and 
associated   retail   units.      The   second   stage,   comprising   53   apartments   and 
six commercial  units,  together  with  a  two-storey  commercial  building,  commenced 
in December 2005 on the basis of building consents issued in June 2005. 
[15] It was assumed, wrongly, that the necessary resource consents for the second 
stage  had  been  obtained.   When  it  emerged  in  early  2006  that  this  was not  the  case 
work on stage two stopped. 
                                                 8  Below at [108]. 9  See High Court judgment, above n 1, at [2].   [16] For  various  reasons,  including  objections  by  a  group  of  stage  one  apartment 
owners,  there  were  unexpected  delays  and  a  retrospective  resource  consent  was  not 
granted  until  March  2008.    As  the  consent  conditions  were more  restrictive  than 
sought, there was an appeal which was not resolved until 2010. 
[17] As  Rodney  Hansen  J  noted,10 the  delay  and  the  modified  terms  of  consent 
substantially  impacted  on  the  profitability  of  the  project.    Indeed  it  ultimately 
resulted in a loss.  MS St Lukes' liabilities exceeded its assets (which included a debt 
due  by  MSE  of  $1,268,640)  by $1,515,012 as  at  31  March  2007.11  In  2009, 
following  its  failure  to pay  a  debt  of  $128,569.46,  MS  St  Lukes  was  placed  into 
liquidation on the application of creditors.12  The liquidators' report indicates it owed 
more than $15,000,000 and had negligible assets. 
Mr Morgenstern's overdrawn current account with MSE 
[18] In  the  meantime  Mr  Morgenstern  was  also  facing  difficulties  with  MSE 
which  by  March  2007  was  coming  under  financial  pressure,  having  undertaken  a 
joint venture development (the Axon House development) which was not financially 
successful.  MSE was balance sheet insolvent and being sued as guarantor of a rental 
underwrite deed for $127,077.80.13   
[19] Mr  Morgenstern  had  an  overdrawn  current  account  with  MSE.    As  at 
31 March 2005 the overdrawn balance was $1,776,336.  Rodney Hansen J's finding 
that drawings during the year ended 31 March 2006 increased the overdrawn balance 
was not challenged on appeal.14  It is now accepted by Mr Morgenstern that the best 
case  from  his  point  of  view is  that  the  overdrawn  balance  was  $1,871,787  on 
31 March 2007.  The respondents say it was much higher. 
  
                                                 10  At [74]. 11  At [81]. 12  Lim  v  Morning  Star  (St  Lukes  Garden  Apartments)  Ltd HC  Auckland  CIV-2009-404-3279, 
14 September 2009.  13  High Court judgment, above n 1, at [13], [17], [18], [99] and [108]–[109].  Summary judgment 
was given in respect of that claim: SAITeysMcMahon Property Ltd v Kingdon Developments Ltd 
DC Auckland CIV-2007-004-403, 1 June 2007. 14  High Court judgment, above n 1, at [75].   Professional advice 
[20] Mr Morgenstern gave evidence at the trial that in late 2006 or early 2007 he 
had  been  given  advice  by  his  accountant,  Mr  Ian  Craig  of  BDO  Spicers, Auckland, 
that he should: 
(a) pay  down  his  overdrawn  current  account  with  MSE  in  order  to  bring 
capital  into  MSE  and  to  avoid  incurring  interest  on  the  overdraft 
which would give rise to deemed interest (for tax purposes); 
(b) do  this  by  selling  his  only  significant  asset,  namely  his  shares  in 
MS St Lukes, to MSE, crediting his current account in payment; and  
(c) establish a market value for the shares in MS St Lukes, otherwise the 
transaction  would  be  open  to  challenge  and  any  difference  between 
the  transaction  value  and  the  actual  value  of  the  shares  would  be 
deemed a dividend. 
[21] Mr  Morgenstern  also  gave  evidence  that  Mr  Craig  agreed  with  his  proposal 
that Mr Reesby should assess the then current value of the St Lukes project and did 
not suggest that a "registered" valuation should be obtained. 
[22] Mr Morgenstern said that after he had obtained Mr Reesby's analysis of the 
expected value of the project he took it to Ms Gina Hull of BDO Spicers, Auckland, 
another  of  his  accountants,  for  discussion  and  review.    Mr  Morgenstern  said  that 
Ms Hull: advised me that I should take a conservative approach to the value and apply 
a 20 per cent discount to Mr Reesby's assessed profit. [23] There  was  no evidence,  however,  that  Ms  Hull  had  been  told  that  the 
St Lukes project had stalled.   Indeed Mr Walker for Mr Morgenstern  acknowledged 
before us that she did not know this had happened.   [24] Mr Morgenstern said that he relied on the advice that he received from BDO 
Spicers, including the appropriate method  for valuing the shares because  he did not 
know what methodology was appropriate. 
[25] Prior  to  the  trial  the  liquidators  objected  to  aspects  of  Mr  Morgenstern's 
evidence  relating  to  the  advice  given  by  BDO  Spicers on  the  grounds  that  it  was 
inadmissible  hearsay  evidence.    The  Judge  decided  that  the  evidence  should  be 
admitted and that its hearsay nature should go to the weight to be given to it.  
[26] Neither  Mr  Craig  nor  Ms  Hull  gave  written  advice  to  Mr Morgenstern  in 
2006–2007  and  neither  was  called  to  give  evidence  at  the  trial.   The  only  evidence 
from BDO Spicers was a letter dated 1 September 2010 from Mr Craig to Mr Walker 
providing Mr Morgenstern's responses to the liquidators' proposed claims.  Mr Craig 
stated in his letter that: BDO Auckland was not asked to undertake a formal valuation of the shares 
and  did  not  undertake  such  a  valuation.    The  land,  buildings  and  future 
development were valued as detailed in this letter [by Mr Reesby].  In order 
to obtain a valuation of the shares a discount of greater than 20% for risk and 
profit was applied. [27] Mr Craig went on to say in his letter: We  previously  indicated  the  purpose  of  the  transfer  in  [sic]  the  shares  to 
MSE was to remove the burden of an overdrawn current account. 
The shareholder was able to sell an asset to the company for value but could 
not do so for excess value. 
At the time of the transfer the project appeared to be fully profitable. 
... 
The  value  of  $3.465m  was  at  least  what  a  willing  but  not  anxious  buyer 
would have paid a willing but not anxious seller for the shares at the date of 
transfer, given the information known at the time.  The transfer price was not 
less  than  the  market  value.    Subsequent  diminution  in  the  market  value  is 
irrelevant. [28] Rodney Hansen J accepted the evidence of one of the expert witnesses for the 
liquidators  that  any  advice  given  by  Mr Craig  to  Mr  Morgenstern  to  pay  down  his   overdrawn  current  account  in  MSE  would  have  been  "orthodox  enough".15  
Mr James   Sclater,   a   chartered   accountant, professional   company   director   and 
member  of  the  Institute  of  Directors,  who  gave  evidence  for  the  liquidators,  also 
accepted that, if the shares in MS St Lukes were Mr Morgenstern's only asset, the 
proposed  transaction  would  not  have  been  unreasonable.    Rodney  Hansen  J  did  not 
accept, however, that Mr Morgenstern had established that this was the case.16 
The value of the shares in MS St Lukes 
[29] Mr  Morgenstern  acknowledged  under  cross-examination  that  his  shares  in 
MS St Lukes had no value on the open market in March 2007.  He claimed, however, 
that their value was $3,500,000 to MSE because of his continued involvement in the 
project  and  the  return  he  said  it  was  expected  to  yield.    But  no  independent  expert 
valuation  of  the  fair  market  value  of  the  shares  in  MS St  Lukes  was  obtained  by 
anyone  prior  to  the  sale  of  the  shares  to  MSE  in  March 2007  or  for  the  purpose  of 
supporting  or  opposing  the  liquidators'  claims  against  Mr Morgenstern   and 
Ms Lavas. 
[30] Instead, as already noted, Mr Morgenstern, ostensibly acting on the advice of 
BDO  Spicers,  relied  on  Mr  Reesby  to  assess  the  current  value  of  the  St  Lukes 
project.  Mr Reesby prepared a "feasibility study" or "profit assessment" or "profit 
summary" designed to show, for the benefit of the lenders, the project's financial 
position  as  at  28  February  2007.    Mr  Reesby  calculated  a  projected  profit  of 
$4,429,000. 
[31] For the purpose of his feasibility study, Mr Reesby assumed that construction 
of  stage  one  would  recommence  in  June  2007  and  be  completed  by  May  2008.  
Mr Reesby  assumed  an  average  value  of  $360,000  for  the  remaining  apartments: 
those in building "G" and $374,000 for apartments in building "H".  He allowed 
interest of $600,000 on existing stage one debt and a further $570,000 for stage two 
debt. 
                                                 15  At [104]. 16  At [94] and [106].   [32] Mr Morgenstern  regarded Mr Reesby's feasibility study as providing a fair 
and accurate analysis of the expected value of the project. 
[33] Mr Reesby gave evidence at the trial.  In his brief of evidence he said that he 
did not know that the feasibility study would be used for the purpose of a sale of the 
shares.      He   explained   under   cross-examination   that   what   counsel   called   the 
feasibility study was a revised budget and profit assessment prepared for the purpose 
of giving the St Lukes development's funders a view of their security position.    He 
said it could be called a "financial projection".  He also said he set out to provide an 
answer to the question "what is our overall position?" 
[34] The   valuation   evidence   for   the   liquidators   at   the   trial   was   given   by 
Mr Downes,  a  chartered  accountant  as  well  as  one  of  the  liquidators,  and  Mr Justin 
Bosley,  another  chartered  accountant.    Neither  was  called  as  an  independent  expert 
share valuer. 
[35] Both gave evidence critical of Mr Reesby's feasibility study.  They said that 
the  shares  in  MS  St  Lukes  were  worthless  when  they  were  acquired  by  MSE  in 
March  2007  because  MS  St  Lukes  was  insolvent.    Under  cross-examination, 
however,  both  accepted  that  the  solvency  of  MS  St  Lukes  should  not  be  assessed 
solely on the basis of its accounts. 
[36] Rodney  Hansen  J  concluded that Mr Reesby's feasibility study (as adjusted 
by  the  20  per  cent  discount)  was  of  no  assistance  in  determining  the  value  of  the 
shares in MS St Lukes.17  As Mr Morgenstern strongly disputes this conclusion and 
the Judge's reasons for it, we address this issue separately later.18 
The interests of MSE 
[37] As  already  noted,19 in  March  2007  when  MSE  purchased  the  99  shares  in 
MS St  Lukes  from  Mr  Morgenstern  it  was  in  serious  financial  difficulties.   At  that 
time  its  principal  creditors  included  trade  creditors ($2,211,420),  MS  St  Lukes 
                                                 17  At [93]. 18  Below at [52]–[71]. 19  Above at [19].   ($1,268,640),  KDL  ($794,986),  Newmarket  Carparks  Ltd  ($716,310)  and  Morning 
Star Development Ltd ($373,417). 
[38] While  Mr  Morgenstern  proceeded  on  the  basis  that  on  30  March  2007  the 
MS St Lukes shares were worth $3,500,000, they were written off in MSE's financial 
statements for the year ended 31 March 2007 to reflect the uncertainty about whether 
the project could be completed and on what terms. 
[39] There was no evidence that, at the time of the sale and purchase of the shares, 
the  position  of  MSE  as  purchaser  had  been  separately  or  independently  considered.  
In particular, there was no evidence explaining why it was in the interests of MSE to 
exchange  a  debt  owed  personally  by  Mr  Morgenstern  for  an  equity  interest  in 
MS St Lukes.    As  Mr Walker  acknowledged  before  us,  the  option  for  MSE  of 
securing  Mr  Morgenstern's  debt  by  way  of  a  personal  guarantee  had  not  been 
explored.  In our view this would have been a better option. 
[40] While Mr Walker submitted that Mr Morgenstern had received advice in  his 
dual  capacities  as  a  director  and  shareholder  of  MSE,  there  was  no  evidence  that 
MSE  had  received  separate,  independent  advice  from  BDO  Spicers.    In  particular, 
there  was  no  evidence  that  BDO  Spicers  had  advised  MSE  that  the  proposed 
transaction was in the best interests of MSE.  Mr Craig's letter of 1 September 2010 
was directed at defending Mr Morgenstern's position. 
Mr Morgenstern's financial position 
[41] Mr  Morgenstern  claimed  that  it  was  in  the  interests  of  MSE  to  replace  his 
current account, which he "couldn't pay back", with "a valuable asset", his shares in 
MS  St  Lukes.    As  Mr  Walker  acknowledged,  however,  there  was  no  evidence  of 
Mr Morgenstern's assets and liabilities to support his claim. 
[42] This is consistent with the Judge's conclusion that Mr Morgenstern could 
have availed himself of his ability to earn funds and raise capital from banks, finance   companies   and   investors   to   meet   financial   obligations,   including   if   necessary 
repayment of his current account with MSE.20 
The High Court judgment 
[43] Against this background, Rodney Hansen J decided that Mr Morgenstern,  as 
a director of MSE, was in breach of his duties under ss 131, 135 and 137 of the Act. 
[44] First, the Judge held that Mr Morgenstern breached his duty under s 131(1) of 
the Act by failing to act in good faith and in the best interests of MSE in putting his 
own  personal  interests  in  satisfying  his  current  account  ahead  of  the  interests  of 
MSE.21  Both  MS  St  Lukes,  with  its  stalled  development project,  and  MSE  were 
under  financial  pressure.22  The  share  transfer  had  been  considered  a  year  earlier  at 
the same price.23  It was remarkable that the later valuation was anticipated with such 
"uncanny  accuracy".24  Mr  Reesby's  feasibility  study  fell  well short   of   the 
requirement for a contemporaneous independent valuation.25  If Mr Morgenstern had 
been advised that the feasibility study was adequate for the purpose, the accountants 
should have been called to defend and explain their evidence.26  
[45] The Judge found that Mr Morgenstern did not honestly believe the sale to be 
in the best interests of MSE.27  The Judge said: [103] I  am  also  not persuaded  that  Mr  Morgenstern  honestly  believed  the 
sale to be in the best interests of MSE.  I believe his dominant purpose was 
to avoid exposure to a claim for recovery of his current account and to shift 
the risk of the St Lukes project to MSE and, through MSE, to its creditors.  [46] The  Judge  also  found  that  there  was  a  central  fallacy  in  the  proposition  that 
the acquisition of the shares would "capitalise" MSE.  The Judge said: [107] Leaving  that  to  one  side  there  is,  however,  as  Mr Malarao [then 
counsel  for  the  liquidators] pointed  out,  a  central  fallacy  in  the  proposition 
that  the  acquisition  of  the  shares  would  "capitalise" MSE.      The                                                  20  High Court judgment, above n 1, at [106]. 21  At [97]–[110]. 22  At [99]. 23  At [99] 24  At [100]–[101]. 25  At [102]. 26  At [102] and [110]. 27  At [103].   "capitalisation" of MSE would be dependent on the success of the St Lukes 
development.  The acquisition of the shares would only "capitalise" MSE in 
any   real   sense   if   the   development   were profitable.      In   that   event, 
Mr Morgenstern's ability to repay  his  current  account,  contingent  (on  his 
evidence)  on  the  success  of  the  St  Lukes  development,  would  be  restored.  
The    acquisition    of    the    shares    achieved    nothing    for    MSE    while 
Mr Morgenstern was able to shed his personal liability and  acquire an  asset 
(the balance of the purchase price) which would be repayable if the St Lukes 
development were  profitable.  In a  very real sense, MSE surrendered  a bird 
in the hand for one in the bush. [47] Second, the Judge held that Mr Morgenstern was in breach of his duty under 
s  135  not  to  agree  to  or  cause  or  allow  the  business  of  MSE  to  be  carried  on  in  a 
manner likely to create a substantial risk of serious loss to the company's creditors.  
The  Judge  described  the  transaction  under  which  MSE  purchased  the  shares  as  a 
transaction which went to the heart of the company's business enterprise.28  The 
Judge then said: [112] For   the   reasons   already   canvassed, I   consider   the   transaction 
involved an unacceptable level of risk that could not be justified.  It involved 
the  company  surrendering  a  valuable  asset  (the  debt  recoverable  from 
Mr Morgenstern)  in  exchange  for  shares  in  a  stalled  property  development 
that  had  a  long  way  to  go  before  offering  any  prospect  of  a  return.  
Mr Morgenstern failed to take even the most elementary steps to protect the 
interests of the company.  The risk of serious loss to company creditors was 
palpable. It was a proposal that could not have survived a sober assessment. I 
am satisfied that Mr Morgenstern was in breach of s 135. [48] Third, the Judge held that Mr Morgenstern was in breach of his duty of care 
under s 137.29  The Judge said: [116] In the circumstances that existed at the time of the share sale,  I am 
satisfied that Mr Morgenstern's actions fell well short of the standard to be 
expected of a reasonable director. Mr Sclater drew my attention to a number 
of respects in which  the company's  recordkeeping was deficient.  These 
included the failure to produce timely accounts; the failure to keep and [sic] 
interests  register;  and  the  omission  to  ratify  the  share  sale,  as  a  major 
transaction, by special resolution as required by s 129 of the Act.  However, 
the  most  egregious  omission  was  Mr Morgenstern's  failure  to  obtain  an 
independent  share  valuation  by  a  suitably  qualified  person.  I  am  satisfied 
that a reasonable director in Mr Morgenstern's position would have done so.  
He is accordingly in breach of s 137 of the Act. [49] As already mentioned, on the basis of these three findings of breach of duty, 
the   Judge   exercised   the   power   of   the   Court   under   s   301(1)(b)   and   ordered 
                                                 28  At [111]. 29  At [113]–[116].   Mr Morgenstern  to  restore  MSE  to  the  position  it  was  in  before  the  shares  were 
transferred on 30 March 2007 by paying the sum of $3,499,999 to MSE.30 
[50] It  is  implicit  in  his  judgment  that  Rodney  Hansen  J  was  satisfied  that  the 
findings  of  breach  of  duty  and  the  order  for  payment  of  $3,499,999  could  be  made 
notwithstanding  his  earlier  finding  that  the  liquidators  had  not  made  out  a  case  for 
recovery under s 298.31  The liquidators' claim under s 298 failed because while the 
Judge  was  satisfied  the  consideration  paid  by  MSE  was  "excessive",  he  had  no 
reliable means of determining by how much. 
[51] Underpinning each of the Judge's findings of breach of the Act was his view 
that Mr Morgenstern was under an obligation to ensure that MSE paid a "fair value" 
for  his  shares  in  MS  St  Lukes  on  the  basis  of  an  independent  valuation  of  the 
shares.32 
The "fair value" of the shares in MS St Lukes 
The Judge's approach 
[52] As already noted,33 Rodney Hansen J concluded that Mr Reesby's feasibility 
study  (as  adjusted  by  the  20  per  cent  discount)  was  of  no  assistance  in  determining 
the value of the shares in MS St Lukes.  The Judge's reasons for this conclusion 
were: 
(a) The  feasibility  study  was  an  assessment  of  the  profitability  of  the 
development  project,  not  a  valuation  of  the  shares  which  involved 
more than a valuation of the company's main asset.34 
(b) The  feasibility  study  may  have  been  acceptable  for  the  purpose  of 
reporting  to  the project's funders, but it was a wholly unsatisfactory 
basis for establishing fair value for a related-party transaction.35 
                                                 30  At [117]–[120]. 31  At [96]. 32  At [98]. 33  Above at [36]. 34  High Court judgment, above n 1, at [85]. 35  At [86].   (c) Property  values  used  exceeded  valuation  (which  themselves  did  not 
meet  formal  reporting  standards)  and,  in  the  case  of  the  residential 
apartments,  did  not  appear  to  be  supported  by  "actual  sales  of 
comparable units in the same complex".36 
(d) An  allowance  for  interest  of  $600,000  (on  the  stage  one  debt)  was 
demonstrably    inadequate.        Even    after    expected    realisations, 
substantial debt levels would persist until completion.37 
(e) The   feasibility   study   itself   made   no   allowance   for   risks   and 
contingencies.  They were allowed for in the 20 per cent discount, but 
that was never explained or justified.38 
(f) The  uncertainties  associated  with  the  resource  consents  required 
before  the  St  Lukes  project  could  be  completed  were  unrealistically 
minimised by Mr Morgenstern.39 
Submissions for Mr Morgenstern 
[53] Mr Walker submits that the Judge's conclusion was wrong and that none of 
his  reasons  was  correct.  In  particular,  Mr  Walker  submits  that  Mr  Reesby  was 
"well-positioned" to prepare the analysis of the profitability of the project by reason 
of  his  academic  qualifications,  his  experience  in  corporate  and  commercial  finance, 
and  his  responsibility  for  supervising  the  finances  of  the  St  Lukes  project  and  for 
reporting to both the BNZ and Structured Finance on the expected profitability of the 
project.    Mr  Walker  suggested  that  Mr  Reesby  had  not  been  challenged  on  his 
evidence  about  the  preparation  of  his  assessment  of  the  profitability  of  the  project 
and that the liquidators had not called  evidence to prove that the shares  were worth 
less than MSE paid.  Mr Walker was particularly critical of the "desktop" valuation 
carried out by Mr Bosley, which was based solely on the accounts for MS St Lukes. 
                                                 36  At [87]. 37  At [88]. 38  At [89] and [91]. 39  At [90]. 
   [54] In respect of the Judge's specific reasons for concluding that Mr Reesby's 
feasibility  study  was  of  no  assistance  in  determining  the  value  of  the  shares  in 
MS St Lukes, Mr Walker submits: 
(a) It was "a valuation of the St  Lukes Garden Apartment project owned 
by MS St Lukes, not of the shares in MS St Lukes".   
(b) While  a  valuation  of  the  shares  would  have  taken  into  account 
potential  surplus  assets  (related-party  balances)  and  any  creditors  not 
taken  into  account  in  valuing the  project,  there  was  no  evidence  that 
"such supplementary matters" would have made any difference to the 
value assessed by Mr Reesby. 
(c) The property values assumed by Mr Reesby did not exceed valuations 
and,  in  the  case  of  residential  apartments,  were  supported  by  actual 
sales of comparable units in the same complex. 
(d) Mr Reesby did not miscalculate interest on the debt owing through to 
the end of the project. 
(e) There  was  no  evidence  to  support  the  finding  that  the  20  per  cent 
discount was inadequate. 
(f) The  substantial  uncertainties  concerning  the  resource  consents  only 
arose  when  owners  of  the  development  raised  objections  to  the 
completion of stage two, after March 2007.  
Legal principles 
[55] There  is  no  dispute  that  the  duties  imposed  on  directors  by  ss  131,  135  and 
137 are owed to the company and require directors to act in the best interests of the  
 
    company.  A director must not put his or her personal interests ahead of those of the 
company.40  The duties arise regardless of the size of a director's shareholding  and 
role in the company.   They apply even if the shareholding is 100 per cent.  It is also 
well-established  that,  at  least  when  a  company  is  in  financial  difficulties,  the  duties 
extend  to  a  requirement  to  take  into  account  the  interests  of  the  company's 
creditors.41 
[56] The existence of these duties means that when there is a transaction between 
a  director  and  the  company  there  is  likely  to  be  a  conflict  of  interest  between  the 
director's personal interests and the separate interests of the company.  A director 
who is interested in such a transaction must disclose it to the company.42  Unless the 
transaction is for "fair value", the company may avoid it within three months.43  If a 
director seeks to uphold the transaction, the onus of establishing fair value is on the 
director.44 
[57] Similarly,  a  director  involved  in  such  a  transaction  who  wishes  to  avoid 
breaching the director's duties to the company will need to be able to satisfy a court 
that the transaction was for fair value.45 
[58] In  a  situation  where  there  is  no  contemporaneous  independent  valuation  and 
the parties have to rely on the records of the company, it is not unjust to impose an 
onus of proof in respect of establishing fair value at the time of a transaction on the 
director.46  The director, who is likely to be in possession of the relevant information, 
will be in a better position to discharge the onus than the company's liquidators.47

[2007] NZCA 304, [2008] 1 NZLR 340 at [59]–[60].   The onus should not therefore be on the liquidators as Mr Walker suggested. 
[59] As  this  Court  held  in Robb v  Sojourner,  to establish "fair value" in a case 
such  as  this  one  the  director  would  be  well  advised  to  obtain  a  contemporaneous 
independent valuation of the assets being acquired.  As this Court warned:48 In terms of both the process adopted and the price which is eventually fixed, 
directors would be well advised to err on the side of caution as if the sale is 
later  held  to  have  been  at  an  undervalue,  the  liability  of  the  directors  may 
well exceed the discrepancy between the contract price and fair value. [60] We  therefore  do  not  accept  Mr  Walker's  submission  that  the  decision  in 
Robb v Sojourner applies only to the steps directors would be advised to take if they 
want  to  avoid  a  claim  under  the  avoidance  provisions  and  is  not  authority  for  the 
proposition that a reasonable director engaged in a self-interested transaction should 
obtain  a  contemporaneous  independent  valuation.    Mr  Davies,  counsel  for  the 
liquidators,  also  pointed  out that the  obligation  on  a  reasonable  director  in  this 
situation   is   recognised   by   the   relevant   Institute of   Chartered  Accountants   of 
New Zealand Standard.49  
[61] As  Mr  Craig  recognised  in  his  letter  of  1  September  2010,  when  the 
transaction  involves  a  sale  and  purchase  of  shares  between  the  director  and  the 
company,  a  contemporaneous  independent  valuation would  require  the  valuer  to 
determine  the  value  of  the  shares  in  accordance  with  the  well-established  test, 
namely the value at which a willing but not anxious vendor would sell and a willing 
but not anxious purchaser would buy.50  This is essentially a practical question, not to 
be overlaid by philosophical or legal niceties.

capitalisation   of   earnings,   price   earnings   ratio,   and   liquidation.51  Which 
methodology is used will depend on the purpose of the valuation. 
[63] Bearing in mind the onus of proof and the risk for directors involved in such 
transactions,  they  would  be  well-advised  to  obtain  the  requisite  independent  share 
valuation from an expert in share valuations. 
Application here 
[64] Applying these legal principles here, there is no doubt that Mr Morgenstern, 
in  his  capacity  as  a  director  of  MSE,  had  a  conflict  of  interest  when  it  came  to  the 
purchase by MSE of his shares in MS St Lukes for the purpose of the repayment of 
his  personal MSE  loan  account.    The  fact  that  Mr  Morgenstern  owned  99  of  the 
100 shares in MSE made no difference.  As the sole director of MSE he still owed all 
the duties a director owes and was required to take into account the interests of MSE 
and, in view of MSE's financial difficulties, the interests of its creditors. 
[65] Consequently, as Rodney Hansen J correctly held, Mr Morgenstern was under 
an obligation to ensure that MSE paid a "fair value" for his shares in MS St Lukes.  
In   the   absence   of   a   contemporaneous   independent   valuation   of   the   shares, 
Mr Morgenstern  faced  the  onus  of  proving  that  the  shares  were  purchased  by  MSE 
for "fair value" with the difficulties he encountered later once MS St Lukes had 
collapsed.    In  this  situation  the  onus  was  not  on  the  liquidators.    The  fact  that  the 
"desktop"  valuation  for  the  liquidators  could  be  criticised  is  therefore  of  little 
relevance.  
[66] Mr Morgenstern has failed to discharge his onus.  He was intimately involved 
in  the  affairs  of  MS  St  Lukes  and  had  access  to  all  the  relevant  information.    The 
liquidators  were  not  liquidators  of  MS  St  Lukes  and  did  not  have  the  necessary 
information about that company.   
                                                 51  AV Adamson The  Valuation  of  Company  Shares  and  Businesses (5th  ed,  Law  Book  Company, 
Sydney, 1975); Vern Krishna "Determining the 'Fair Value' of Corporate Shares" (1987) 13 Can 
Bus  LJ 132;  and  David  Bowes Tolley's  Practical  Share  and  Business  Valuation (LexisNexis, 
London, 2008) at [9.1]–[10.57].    [67] We  agree  with  Rodney Hansen  J  that  Mr  Reesby's  feasibility  study  (as 
adjusted by the 20 per cent discount) was not an independent valuation of the shares: 
(a) Mr  Reesby  was  not  an  independent  expert  share  valuer.    Mr  Reesby 
was  associated  with  the  St  Lukes  project.    He  was  not  independent.  
He  did  not  claim  to  be  qualified  or  experienced  as  an  expert  share 
valuer as required by the Code of Conduct for expert witnesses.52  He 
was  not  aware  that  his  feasibility  study  was  going  to  be  used  for  the 
purpose of valuing the shares. 
(b) As Mr Walker acknowledged, the feasibility study was not a valuation 
of the shares in MS St Lukes.  It did not determine the value at which 
a  willing  but  not  anxious  vendor  would  sell  and  a  willing  but  not 
anxious   purchaser   would   buy   the   shares.      The   purpose   of   the 
feasibility  study  was  to  assess  the  value  of  the  St  Lukes  project  in 
order to give the project's funders  a  view  of  their  security  position.  
As Rodney Hansen J held, the feasibility study was therefore a wholly 
unsatisfactory basis for founding a related-party transaction. 
[68] The  unsatisfactory  nature  of  the  feasibility  study  as  a  share  valuation  is  also 
reinforced by the Judge's other reasons for rejecting it.  Mr Walker's submissions 
that  there  was  no  evidence  that  any  supplementary  matters  would  have  made  any 
difference to Mr Reesby's value and to  support  the  finding  that the  20  per  cent 
discount was inadequate overlooked the fact that the onus was on Mr Morgenstern to 
adduce  evidence  to  establish  these  propositions  affirmatively.    He  failed  to  adduce 
such  evidence.    Mr Walker's submission also overlooked his acknowledgment that 
Ms Hull's advice about the 20 per cent discount was given without knowing that the 
St Lukes project was stalled. 
[69] We also accept the Judge's other criticisms of the feasibility study: 
                                                 52  High  Court  Rules,  r  9.43  and  sch  4;  and  Evidence  Act  2006,  s  26.   McGechan  on  Procedure

Brookers, Wellington, 2014) at [EV26.01].   (a) As  Mr  Davies  pointed  out,  the  Judge's  findings  that  the  property 
values used by Mr Reesby exceeded valuations were supported by the 
evidence.  The value for the "Stage One Retail" project of $3,500,000, 
based  on  estimates  by  Mr  Reesby,  was  more  than  $600,000  greater 
than  was  given  in  an  informal  assessment  by  Seager  Partners.    The 
values  of  the  apartments  in  stage  two  (buildings  G  and  H)  used  in 
Mr Reesby's feasibility study and the values of the unsold apartments 
ranging   from   $470,000   to   $375,000   did   not   follow   the   values 
achieved  from  "actual  sales  of  comparable  units  in  the  same 
complex", as claimed by Mr Reesby.  When taken to the evidence of 
what  sales  had  been  achieved  up  to  7  February  2007,  Mr Reesby 
accepted under cross-examination that very few of the apartment sales 
actually  came  near  his  lower  average  estimate  of  $360,000.    The 
actual values were considerably lower. 
(b) The  allowance  of  $600,000  in  further  interest  (on  a  total  debt  of 
$16,500,000) was plainly inadequate.  In the short period February to 
May   2007,   over   $600,000   of   interest   had   actually   accrued   on 
Structured  Finance/Fidelity  mezzanine  loans.53  Additional  interest 
would  also  have  continued  to  accrue  to  BNZ,  the  primary  lender.  
Under  cross-examination  Mr  Reesby  was  unable  to  explain  what  the 
$600,000  was  supposed  to  cover.    Clearly  significantly  more  interest 
than  $600,000  was  going  to be  accrued.    In  addition  $300,000  of  the 
$600,000     had     already     been     incurred     on     the     Structured 
Finance/Fidelity loan between January and the end of March 2007. 
(c) The  feasibility  study  contained  no  analysis  of  the  risks  and  no 
reasoning  for  the  20  per  cent  discount  that  was  applied.    The  risks 
included: obtaining the Council's consent in a timely manner; funding 
the   development   and   the   costs   of   doing   so;   completing   the 
construction on time and to budget; and selling the units at estimated 
prices within the required timeframe.  
                                                 53  Fidelity Finance Ltd was Mr Reesby's company.  Part of the St Lukes debt was assigned to it.   (d) There  was  ample  evidence  to  support  the  Judge's  view  that 
Mr Morgenstern   had   unrealistically   minimised   the   uncertainties 
associated  with  the  resource  consents  required  before  the  St  Lukes 
project   could   be   completed.      The   project   had   stalled   prior   to 
March 2007  when  it  was  discovered  that  the  necessary  resource 
consents  for  stage  two  had  not  been  obtained.    This  followed  the 
decision  of  the  Auckland  City  Council,  in  May  2006,  to  issue  a 
Project  Information  Memorandum  unexpectedly  imposing  five  major 
conditions   which   led   to   the   development   being   altered.      Both 
Mr Reesby  and  Mr Morgenstern  experienced  difficulties  with  the 
Auckland City Council in the resource consent process. 
[70] Mr Morgenstern's failure to obtain a contemporaneous independent valuation 
of the shares in MS St Lukes means that he is unable to establish that the shares were 
purchased by MSE at "fair value".  In particular, Mr Morgenstern has failed to prove 
that the consideration of $3,465,000 represented the "fair value" of the shares  as  at 
30 March 2007. 
[71] Mr  Morgenstern's  attempt  to  rely  on  Mr  Craig's  subsequent  letter  of 
1 September  2010  to  support  the  value  of  $3,465,000  is  misconceived  as  Mr  Craig 
was  not  called  as  a  witness.    In  particular,  Mr  Craig  did  not  appear  to  justify  his 
views  which  were  inconsistent  with  the  evidence  before  the  Court  relating  to  the 
deficiencies in Mr Reesby's feasibility study in light of the stalled project and the 
inadequacy of the 20 per cent discount. 
Reliance on professional advice 
The Judge's approach 
[72] As already noted,54 Rodney Hansen J held that, if Mr Morgenstern wished to 
rely  on  the  advice,  which  he  said  he  had  received  from  BDO  Spicers,  to  repay  his 
overdrawn current account with MSE by selling his shares in MS St Lukes to MSE 
on   the   basis   of   Mr  Reesby's  feasibility  study,  then  it  was  necessary  for 
Mr Morgenstern to call evidence from his advisers at BDO Spicers. 
                                                 54  Above at [44].   [73] The Judge did not accept the liquidators' submission that Mr Morgenstern 
was  obliged  by  s  138  of  the  Act  to  plead  affirmatively  reliance on BDO Spicers' 
advice.55  Rather  the  Judge  decided  that  Mr Morgenstern's failure to call evidence 
from the advisers meant that it was open to the Court to draw an adverse inference.56 
Submissions for Mr Morgenstern 
[74] Mr  Walker  agrees  with  the  Judge  that  s 138(2)  is  inapplicable  because 
Mr Morgenstern   is   not   seeking   to   raise   an   affirmative   defence   under   s   138.  
Mr Morgenstern's case is simply that the fact he took advice from BDO Spicers and 
acted in accordance with it was evidence that he was acting in good faith and in the 
best  interests  of  MSE.    On  this  basis  Mr  Walker  submits  it  was  unnecessary  for 
Mr Morgenstern to call  evidence from his advisers and no adverse inference should 
be   drawn   because   Mr Morgenstern's  evidence  was  before  the  Court  and  the 
liquidators could have called or interviewed Mr Craig or Ms Hull. 
Legal principles 
[75] The starting point is that s 138 explicitly recognises that a director is entitled 
to  rely  on  professional  advice.   As  Rodney  Hansen  J  accepted,57 s  138  provides  an 
affirmative defence to a claim of breach of statutory duty by excusing a director who 
relies on information provided or advice given by an employee, professional adviser 
or  fellow  director  and  who  acts  in  good  faith,  makes  proper  inquiry  and  has  no 
knowledge  that  such  reliance  is  unwarranted.58  As  with  other  affirmative  defences, 
the onus of proof is on the director to establish the defence.59  Under the High Court 
Rules, an affirmative defence should also be pleaded.60   
[76] A  director  seeking  to  rely  on  the  affirmative  defence  will  therefore  need  to 
adduce   evidence   establishing   the   nature   and   scope   of   the   advice   and   the 
                                                 55  High Court judgment, above n 1, at [21]. 56  At [102]. 57  At [21]. 58  Mason  v  Lewis [2006]  3  NZLR  225  (CA)  at  [77]; Sojourner  v  Robb,  above  n 41,  at  [48]–[50]; 
and Re Cellar House Ltd (in liq) HC Nelson CP13/00, 18 March 2004 at [217]. 59  Humphrey v Fairweather [1993] 3 NZLR 91 (HC) at 94 and Law Commission Law Relating to 
Civil Penalties (NZLC IP33, 2010) at [6.42]. 60  Rule  5.48(4);  and Manukau  Golf  Club  Inc  v  Shoye  Venture  Ltd [2012]  NZCA  154,  (2012) 
21 PRNZ 235 at [22] (rev'd in part on the question of costs: [2012] NZSC 109, [2013] 1 NZLR 
305).   circumstances justifying the director's reliance on the advice.  At the very least the 
director would be expected to adduce direct evidence from the professional advisers 
and make them available for cross-examination.61 
[77] A   director   who   does   not   adduce   direct   evidence   from   the   relevant 
professional  advisers  is  unlikely  to  be  able  to  establish  the  defence  solely  on  the 
basis  of  his  or  her  own  evidence.    As  this  Court  pointed  out  in Mason  v  Lewis,62 
little,  if  any,  weight  could  appropriately  be  given  to  a  director's  suggestion  in 
evidence that he had been reassured as to his company's prospects by his accountant, 
who was not called. 
[78] Furthermore,  failure  to  adduce  evidence  from  the  relevant  professional 
advisers would support the inference that their evidence would not assist the director 
when the director would be expected to call them as witnesses, their evidence would 
explain or elucidate their advice and their absence is unexplained.63  In a civil case, 
contrary  to  Mr Walker's suggestion, there is no obligation on a party to call the 
professional  advisers  of  the  other  party  as  witnesses.   An  adverse  inference  may  be 
drawn where a witness is in the "camp" of one party and it would be natural for that 
party to produce the witness.64  This is particularly the case where the witness has a 
relationship of confidence with the party,65 and, specifically, where the witness is the 
party's accountant.66 
Application here 
[79] Mr  Morgenstern  did  not  plead  as  an  affirmative  defence  under  s  138  that  in 
proceeding with the sale of his shares in MS St Lukes to MSE he had relied on the 
professional  advice  of  Mr  Craig  and  Ms  Hull  of  BDO  Spicers.    Nor  did  he  seek  to 
amend  his  statement  of  defence during  the  High  Court  trial  or  adduce  any  direct 
                                                 61  Mason v Lewis, above n 58, at [82]. 62  At [82]. 63  Jones  v  Dunkel (1959)  101  CLR  298  at  308,  312  and  320–321; Perry  Corp  v  Ithaca

Australia  Ltd [2011]  HCA  11,  (2011)  243  CLR  361  at  [63]–[64];  and Forivermor  Ltd  v  ANZ 
Bank New Zealand Ltd [2014] NZCA 129 at [15] (leave to appeal refused [2014] NZSC). 64  JD Heydon Cross on Evidence (8th ed, Lexis Nexis Butterworths, Australia, 2010) at [1215]. 65  Payne v Parker [1976] 1 NSWLR 191 (CA) at 201–202 per Glass JA. 66  Steele  v  Mirror  Newspapers  Ltd [1974]  2  NSWLR  348  (CA)  at  366–367  per  Hutley  JA  and 
Payne v Parker, above n 65, at 202.   evidence  from  Mr  Craig  or  Ms  Hull  as  to  the  nature  and  scope  of  their  advice.  
Instead he relied solely on his own evidence of what he said he had been advised and 
Mr Craig's subsequent letter of 1 September 2010. 
[80] In declining to accept the liquidators' submission that Mr Morgenstern could 
not rely on his affirmative defence under s 138 without pleading it the Judge said:67 It   may  be  that  in  order  to  avail  himself  specifically  of  the  defence, 
Mr Morgenstern was required to plead s 138 but I think Mr Walker is right to 
say  that  for  the  purpose  of  considering  whether  or  not  there  has  been  a 
breach of a relevant statutory duty, it must be necessary to consider whether 
Mr Morgenstern relied on information provided and advice given by others. [81] As Mr Morgenstern does not rely on the affirmative defence, we approach the 
issue  of  his  reliance  on  the  BDO  Spicers'  advice  in  the  same  way  as  Rodney 
Hansen J did.  We are satisfied that, in the absence of any evidence from Mr Craig or 
Ms Hull, his reliance on the advice must fail.  Our reasons are simply that: 
(a) Mr  Morgenstern  was  obliged  by  the  onus  of  proof  on  him  to  adduce 
direct evidence from his professional advisers on whom he claimed to 
have relied. 
(b) In  the  absence  of  any direct  evidence  from  his  professional  advisers, 
Mr Morgenstern's own evidence and Mr Craig's letter of 1 September 
2010 could be given little, if any, weight. 
(c) The unexplained absence of the professional advisers, whose evidence 
was  necessary  to  establish  Mr Morgenstern's case, entitles the Court 
to  draw  the  adverse  inference  that  their  evidence  would  not  have 
assisted Mr Morgenstern.  In particular, the Court may infer that there 
was  no  adequate  explanation  for  the  failures  to  obtain  a  proper 
valuation  of  the  shares  and  to  ensure  that  MSE  received  independent 
advice. 
                                                 67  High Court judgment, above n 1, at [21].   [82] Mr Morgenstern's claim that in entering into the transaction for the sale of his 
shares in MS St Lukes to MSE on the basis of professional advice therefore fails. 
Breaches of duties 
[83] With   the   failure  of  Mr  Morgenstern's  principal  defences  based  on 
Mr Reesby's feasibility study and reliance on professional advice from BDO Spicers, 
we have little difficulty in upholding the judgment of Rodney Hansen J in respect of 
Mr Morgenstern's breaches of ss 131, 135 and 137. 
Section 131 
[84] Mr Morgenstern clearly failed to act in good faith and in what he believed to 
be  the  best  interests  of  MSE.    Notwithstanding  Mr Walker's  submissions  to  the 
contrary, we are satisfied that the evidence at the trial provided ample support for the 
Judge's credibility findings that Mr Morgenstern did not honestly believe the sale to 
be in the best interests of MSE and that his dominant purpose was to avoid exposure 
to  a  claim  for  recovery  of  his  current  account by  shifting the  risk  of  the  St  Lukes 
project to MSE and, through MSE, to its creditors.  
[85] In  our  view  these  findings  were  inevitable  when  the  following  factors  are 
taken into account: 
(a) The  sale  of  the  shares  was  a  related-party  transaction  in  which 
Mr Morgenstern was under a conflict of interest. 
(b) The transaction was solely for his own personal benefit. 
(c) No  consideration  was  given  to  the  interests  of  MSE  or  to  alternative 
means of security for MSE. 
(d) The  share  transfer  had  been  considered  a  year  earlier  at  the  same 
price. 
(e) No independent share valuation was obtained.     (f) The required process of approving a major transaction under s 129 of 
the Act was not followed. 
Section 135 
[86] Mr  Morgenstern  clearly  engaged  in  reckless  trading.    In  the  circumstances 
that existed in March 2007, the purchase of the shares by MSE was likely to create a 
substantial risk of serious loss to the company's creditors. 
[87] We  agree  with  Rodney  Hansen  J  that  the  share  transaction  amounted  to 
reckless  trading  because  it  had  the  potential  to  cause  the  demise  of MSE.   The  fact 
that it was a single transaction does not preclude a finding of reckless trading. 
[88] In our view the fact that MSE failed within a year of the transaction served to 
confirm how reckless the transaction was as far as MSE was concerned. 
Section 137 
[89] Mr Morgenstern clearly breached the duties of care, diligence and skill that a 
reasonable director would have observed in the same circumstances.  As Mr Walker 
acknowledged,  the  test  under  s  137  is  an  objective  one  based  on  the  standard  of  a 
reasonable director.   In our view no reasonable director would have proceeded with 
this transaction which was clearly only in the interests of Mr Morgenstern. 
Inconsistent findings? 
[90] In  addition  to  the  submissions  for  Mr  Morgenstern  which  we  have  already 
rejected, we address here Mr Walker's submission that no breach of duty should have 
been found because Rodney Hansen J had held in relation to the liquidators' claim 
under  s  298  that  the  liquidators  had  failed  to  prove  that  the  shares  were  worth  less 
than  the  consideration  received.    The  other  way  Mr  Walker  puts  this  submission  is 
that the Judge's finding that the consideration was excessive was inconsistent with 
his decision to dismiss the liquidators' claim under s 298. 
[91] The short answer is that the liquidators' claim under  s 298(1)  required  proof 
of  the  amount  by  which  the  value  of  the  consideration  exceeded  the  value  of  the   business  at  the  time  of  the  acquisition,  while  the  claims  under  ss  131,  135  and  137 
required proof of breach of the duties, with the  Court empowered by s 301(1)(b) to 
order restoration of the money lost by the company as a result of the breaches.  The 
fact  that  the  Judge  was  unable  to  determine  by  how  much  the  consideration  was 
excessive for the purpose of the s 298(1) claim did not preclude him from finding the 
breaches of duty under ss 131, 135 and 137 and making the order for any "just" 
restoration under s 301(1)(b).  The Judge's finding in the context of considering the 
s 298 claim that the consideration was "excessive" was therefore consistent with his 
findings in respect of the breaches of duty under ss 131, 135 and 137. 
Relief 
The Judge's approach 
[92] Rodney   Hansen   J   ordered Mr   Morgenstern   to   pay   MSE   the   sum   of 
$3,499,999.68  The Judge made the order on the basis that: 
(a) When   a   director   was   guilty   of breach   of   duty,   the   Court   was 
empowered by s 301(1)(b) of the Act to order the director to repay or 
restore  any  money  or  property  lost  by  the  company  as  a  result  of  the 
breach which it considers is just.69 
(b) Here  MSE  should  be  restored  as  nearly  as  possible  to  the  position  it 
was   in   before   the   share   sale   by   requiring Mr   Morgenstern   to 
"disgorge"  the  benefits  that  flowed  from  the  breach,  namely  the 
elimination  of  his  current  account  and/or  the  credit  to  him  for any 
balance.70 
(c) The  credit  balance  appeared  to  have  been  largely  offset  by  a  debt  of 
$1,612,220  owed  by  Hamina  Enterprises  Ltd  (Hamina),  another  of 
Mr Morgenstern's companies, to MSE.71 
                                                 68  High Court judgment, above n 1, at [120]. 69  At [117]–[118]. 70  At [119]–[120]. 71  At [119], n 32.   Submissions for Mr Morgenstern 
[93] Mr  Walker  submits  that  no  order  should  have  been  made  under  s  301 
because: 
(a) If  there  was  no  sufficient  proof  that  the  shares  were  worth  less  than 
$3,500,000 for the purposes of s 298, this must be equally true for the 
purposes of s 301. 
(b) No loss was caused to  MSE on the date of the transfer because MSE 
received "fair value".  The fact that the value of the shares might 
subsequently fall is irrelevant. 
(c) The Judge's "disgorgement" analysis was inappropriate under s 301, 
particularly   as   there   was   no   net   benefit   to   disgorge   because 
Mr Morgenstern gave fair value for the credit in the current account. 
(d) Even if the shares had been proved to be worth nothing (which is not 
the  case),  the  most  that  the  director  could  be  ordered  to  contribute  is 
the amount of the losses caused to the company.  Anything above that 
amount  would  be  returned  to  him,  as  the  sole  shareholder.    On  the 
liquidators' own case, the claims filed in MSE's liquidation were no 
more  than  $1,315,807.80.    Of  this,  $794,987  was  an  intercompany 
debt to KDL which was wholly owned by Mr Morgenstern. 
Further submissions 
[94] In  the  course  of  the  preparation  of  this  judgment  we  sought  and  obtained 
further  submissions  from  the  parties  on  the  question  whether,  given  the  financial 
difficulties  faced  by  MSE  on  30  March  2007,  it  could  be  argued  that  all  that 
Mr Morgenstern  received  for  his  shares  in  MS  St  Lukes  was  the  cancellation  of  his 
current account debt of $1,871,787 with MSE and a potentially worthless IOU from 
MSE for the balance, if any, of the sale price of $3,500,000.   [95] Mr Davies submits there was in fact no  IOU because Mr Morgenstern had a 
current account debt in excess of $3,500,000 largely because the debt of $1,612,220 
owed by Hamina to MSE had been assumed by Mr Morgenstern prior to the sale of 
the MS St Lukes' shares on 31 March 2007. 
[96] In  response  Mr  Walker  submits  that  the  Hamina  debt  was  not  assumed  by 
Mr Morgenstern until after the sale of the shares.  Mr Walker relies on a BDO work 
paper headed "Morning Star Enterprises Limited 31 March 2007 review note" which 
said: 3.  The collectivity of Hamina Enterprises Limited.   
 
As  per  Gina  Hull's  advise  [sic]  on  12  December  2007,  we  have  offset 
$1612220 owed by Hamina Enterprises Limited with [Mr Morgenstern's] 
personal drawing. [97] There are a number of difficulties with this submission for Mr Morgenstern: 
(a) The  issue  of  the  timing  of  the  assumption  by  Mr  Morgenstern  of  the 
Hamina  debt  was  not  addressed  by  Rodney  Hansen  J  or,  initially,  in 
Mr Morgenstern's appeal to this Court. 
(b) The    evidence    relied    on    by    the    liquidators    indicates    that 
Mr Morgenstern  had  assumed the  Hamina  debt  prior  to  31 March 
2007.  
(c) In  the  face  of  the  evidence  for  the  liquidators,  the  evidence  which 
Mr Morgenstern now seeks to rely on appears particularly flimsy.  The 
reference in the BDO work paper to the date of "12 December 2007" 
appears to be the date of Ms Hull's advice rather than the date of the 
"offset" of the Hamina debt.  The more significant date appears to be 
the reference to "31 March 2007" in the heading of the BDO work 
paper which suggests that Ms Hull's advice related to an event that 
had occurred prior to 31 March 2007.   Legal principles 
[98] The power of the Court to order relief for breach of directors' duties under 
ss 131, 135 and 137 is contained in s 301(1) which provides: 301 Power  of  court  to  require  persons  to  repay  money  or  return 
property 
(1) If,  in  the  course  of  the  liquidation  of  a  company,  it  appears  to  the 
court that a person who has taken part in the formation or promotion 
of the company, or a past or present director, manager, administrator, 
liquidator, or receiver of the company, has misapplied, or retained, or 
become liable or accountable for, money or property of the company, 
or  been  guilty  of  negligence,  default,  or  breach  of  duty  or  trust  in 
relation  to  the  company,  the  court  may,  on  the  application  of  the 
liquidator or a creditor or shareholder,— 
(a) inquire  into  the  conduct  of  the  promoter,  director,  manager, 
administrator, liquidator, or receiver; and 
(b) order that person— 
(i) to repay or restore the money or property or any part 
of it with interest at a rate the court thinks just; or 
(ii) to contribute such sum to the assets of the company 
by way of compensation as the court thinks just; or 
(c) where  the  application  is  made  by  a  creditor,  order  that 
person  to  pay  or transfer the  money  or  property  or any  part 
of  it with  interest  at  a  rate  the  court  thinks  just  to  the 
creditor. [99] As  this  Court  held  in Sojourner  v  Robb,72 relief  under  s  301(1)(b)  will, 
bearing in mind the Court's ultimate discretion,73 be  calculated  by  examining  the 
nature of the breach of duty and by judging the appropriate amount of compensation 
to  be  awarded  based  on  common  law  and  equitable  principles.   A  breach  of  s  131 
involves the breach of a fiduciary obligation, requiring a strict standard of causation 
and imposition of the fiduciary measure of damages, including on a "restitutionary" 
or notional account of profits basis.74  A company's loss, where "loss" is in any event 
the appropriate measure of compensation, is calculated based on the deterioration of 
                                                 72  Sojourner v Robb, above n 41, at [53] and [58]–[59]. 73  Mason v Lewis, above n 58, at [55]. 74  FXHT  Fund  Managers  Ltd  (in  liq)  v Oberholster [2010]  NZCA  197  at  [28]–[30]:  contrast  the 
s 135 and  s  137  duties  (at  [30])  and Robb  v  Sojourner,  above  n 41, at  [31]  and  [60].    Lynne 
Taylor "Liquidation" in John Farrar and Susan Watson (eds) Company  and  Securities  Law  in 
New Zealand (2nd ed, Brookers, Wellington, 2013) 837 at [31.7.2(2)(a)].   its  financial  position  between  the  date  of  the  breach  and  the  date  of  liquidation.75  
The onus is on the delinquent director to prove that the loss, or part of it, would have 
been caused regardless of the breach.76 
[100] Adopting this approach,  the appropriate  amount of compensation will be the 
company's actual loss, that is the amount required to put it back into the position it 
would have been in but for the transaction. 
Application here 
[101] In view of the nature of the breaches of duty by Mr Morgenstern in this case, 
which  included  breach  of  his  duty  to  act  in  good  faith  and  in  the  best  interests  of 
MSE, we agree with Rodney  Hansen J that a  "restitutionary" approach to relief 
under   s 301(1)(b) is   appropriate.      The   fiduciary   nature   of   this   duty,   which 
Mr Morgenstern breached, means that an order for the "disgorgement" of the benefit 
received is appropriate. 
[102] We do not accept Mr Walker's submissions that no order should have been 
made.  In our view: 
(a) There  was  sufficient  proof  that  the  shares  were  worth  less  than 
$3,500,000.      The   Judge   was   satisfied   that   the   price   paid   was 
"excessive".  Mr Morgenstern failed to establish that $3,500,000 was 
the "fair value" of the shares. 
(b) MSE,  which  was  balance  sheet  insolvent  in  March  2007,  did  incur  a 
"but for" loss  of  $3,500,000  due  to  the  share  transfer,  executed  in 
consequence of Mr Morgenstern's breaches of duty, the cancellation 
of Mr Morgenstern's overdrawn current account and the offsetting of 
the debt owed by Hamina, a company owned by him and Ms Lavas. 
[103] Nor do we accept Mr Walker's submission that the maximum amount payable 
under  s  301  should  be  the  loss  suffered  by  the  creditors.    The  problem  with  that 
                                                 75  Mason v Lewis, above n 58, at [109]. 76  FXHT Fund Managers, above n 74, at [28].    approach  is  that  it  does  not  leave  any  funds  to  pay  the  respondents.    We  see  no 
reason why Mr Morgenstern should not be ordered to pay the full $3,499,999 on the 
basis that, if there is a surplus in the liquidation, the money will be returned to him as 
the sole shareholder in any event. 
[104] We therefore agree with Rodney Hansen J that the liquidators were entitled to 
judgment against Mr Morgenstern for $3,499,999. 
Costs appeal 
[105] Mr Morgenstern also appeals against the High Court order for costs in favour 
of  the  liquidators  on  the  grounds  that  the  liquidators  failed  on  two  out  of  three 
transactions  and  seven  out  of ten  causes  of  action  and  most  time  was  spent  on 
matters  on  which  the  liquidators  were  unsuccessful.  Mr  Walker  submits  that  costs 
should be refused or, at minimum, awarded on a reduced basis.77   
[106] Costs  matters  in  relation  to  High  Court  proceedings  are  at  the discretion  of 
that  Court,78 governed  by  the  guiding  principles  in  case  law  and  the  specific  costs 
rules  in  rr  14.2–14.10  of  the  High  Court  Rules.79  Courts should endeavour  to  do 
justice to both sides in considering costs, bearing in mind all material features of the 
case.80  The focus should not be too closely on the question of the extent to which a 
party has "succeeded" or "failed" where there is mixed success.81  Success or failure 
in this context is better assessed by a realistic appraisal of the end result, and of other 
relevant factors.82 
[107] Given the time-pressured context of liquidation, where liquidators may have 
to take action while continuing to investigate a company's affairs, and the fact that 
the  liquidators  in  this  case  obtained  judgment  for  $3,499,999,  the  bulk  of  the 
quantum  which  they  might  have  obtained,  we  do  not  consider  Rodney  Hansen  J 
erred in exercising his discretion to make a costs order in their favour. 
                                                 77  High Court Rules, r 48D.   78  Rule 14.1. 79  McGechan on Procedure (online looseleaf ed, Brookers) at [HR14.1]. 80  Packing In Ltd (in liq) formerly known as Bond Cargo Ltd v Chilcott (2003) 16 PRNZ 869 (CA) 
at [5]. 81  At [5]. 82  At [6].   Cross-appeals 
[108] The liquidators cross-appeal against the High Court findings that: 
(a) they had  not  made  out  a  case  for  recovery  under  s  298  of  the Act  in 
respect of Mr Morgenstern's sale of his shares in MS St Lukes to 
MSE; and 
(b) Mr Morgenstern did not breach his duties under ss 135 and 136 of the 
Act  in  committing  GLL  to  the  carpark  incentive  fee of  $100,000 
annually payable to the purchaser of the Axon House development. 
The s 298 cross-appeal 
[109] As  we  have  already  mentioned,  the  liquidators  also  sought  recovery  of  the 
sum of $3,500,000 from Mr Morgenstern under s 298 of the Act on the basis that the 
consideration  for  the  sale  of  his  shares  in  MS  St  Lukes  to  MSE  was  excessive.  
Rodney Hansen J held that the consideration for the sale was excessive, but declined 
to  order  relief  because  he  was  unable  to  determine  by  how  much  as  required  by 
s 298(1). 
[110] The liquidators' cross-appeal against the Judge's decision not to order relief is 
brought on the narrow ground that once it is established that the consideration for the 
transaction  was  excessive  the  Court  should  strive  to  make  a  finding  and  any 
uncertainty around value should not be resolved against liquidators. 
[111] In  support  of  this  cross-appeal,  Mr  Davies  submits  that  there  were  clear 
evidential  grounds  on  which  the  Judge  could  have  based  a  finding  that  the  shares 
were worthless. 
[112] As   we   have   already   held   that   judgment   should   be   entered   against 
Mr Morgenstern  for  $3,499,999,  no  practical  purpose  would  be  served  in  entering 
judgment  against  him  again  for  the  same  amount  in  the  context  of  the  s  298 
cross-appeal.  For this reason, this cross-appeal is dismissed.   The carpark incentive fee cross-appeal 
[113] The  liquidators,  who  are  also  the  liquidators  of  GLL,  sought  recovery  from 
Mr Morgenstern of an unpaid carpark incentive fee of $100,000 plus GST (annually) 
in  respect  of  another  property  development  (Axon  House)  on  the  grounds  that  as  a 
director of GLL he was in breach of his duties: 
(a) under s 135 of the Act not to agree to, cause or allow the business of 
GLL to be carried on in a manner likely to create a substantial risk of 
serious loss to GLL's creditors; and 
(b) under  s 136  of  the  Act  not  to  agree  to  GLL  incurring  an  obligation 
unless  he  believed  on  reasonable  grounds  that  GLL  would  be  able  to 
perform that obligation when required. 
[114] Rodney Hansen J declined this claim on the grounds that: 
(a) Mr  Morgenstern  reasonably believed  that  the  incentive  payment  was 
only due when at least 50 carparks (not including parks already leased 
at  less  than  market  rates)  had  been  let  at  current  market  rental,  so  it 
could be funded out of receipts;83 and 
(b) Mr Morgenstern reasonably relied on shareholder support from GLL's 
parent   GS   and   LD   Investment   and   Management   Services   Ltd 
(GLIMS).     The   shareholders   decided   to   withdraw   their   support 
because they believed that the incentive payment was not due.84 
[115] In  support  of  this  cross-appeal,  Mr  Davies  submits  that  there  were  no 
reasonable grounds to interpret the carpark deed in the way Mr Morgenstern said he 
did  and  there  was  no  reasonable  basis  for  Mr  Morgenstern  to  rely  on  shareholder 
support when both GLIMS and GLL were insolvent. 
                                                 83  High Court judgment, above n 1, at [66]. 84  At [68]–[69].   [116] The   cross-appeal   depends  on  the  reasonableness  of  Mr  Morgenstern's 
interpretation of clause 2.9 in the carpark deed which provided: Should  at  any  time  during  the  term  of  this  deed,  the  number  of  Carparks 
leased  or  licensed  by  the  Property  Users  fall  below  50  Carpark  spaces 
("minimum  threshold"),  GS  &  LD's  obligation  to  pay  the  Carpark  Fee 
should  be  suspended  for  the  period  during  which  the  number  of  Carparks 
leased  or  licensed  by  the  Property  Users  does  not  exceed  the  minimum 
threshold to  the  intent that no  Carpark  Fee should be payable  by  GS  &  LD 
during the period where the minimum threshold is not being met.  Once the 
number  of  Carparks  leased  by  the  Property  Users  meet  or  exceed  [sic]  the 
minimum threshold, GS & LD's obligations to pay the Carpark Fee shall 
resume   with   the first   payment   due   on   first   day   [sic]   of   the   month 
immediately following the date where the Carparks leased or licensed by the 
Property Users exceeded the minimum threshold. [117] Rodney Hansen J upheld Mr Morgenstern's interpretation of this clause as 
reasonable.  The Judge said:85 [66] In  my  view,  Mr  Morgenstern  had  good  reason  to  expect  that  GLL 
would not be obliged to make an incentive payment unless there were more 
than 50 carparks leased at market rates.  In a memorandum written to him on 
13  May  2005,  Kensington  Swan  had  explained  the  proposed  carparking 
arrangements  on the  basis that GLL would provide carpark space at current 
market  rentals.   The  agreement  for  sale  and  purchase  and  the  carpark  deed 
itself  anticipated  the  lease  of  carparks  at  market  rentals.   The  omission  to 
qualify clause 2.9 may  well have  been a  drafting error.  It seems  inherently 
unlikely  that  Mr  Morgenstern  would  have  committed  GLL  to  making  the 
incentive  payment  without  receiving  a  corresponding  benefit.    It  was  the 
whole purpose of the incentive arrangement.  
[67] Leaving  to  one  side  the  unexpected  difficulty  over  the  incentive 
payment,  the  Newmarket  carpark  appears  to  have  been  operated  in  a 
commercial  and  businesslike  way.    I  was  referred  to  revenue  and  expense 
budgets  for the  2003  2005 period [sic]  which  showed  continuing  growth  in 
revenue  and  profitability  for  the  overall  operation.    It  is  true,  as  Mr  Sclater 
pointed  out,  that  these  budgets  covered  the  whole  operation  of  which  the 
GLL  business  was  just  a  part,  they  were  for  an  earlier period  and  did  not 
include  actual  figures.    However,  I  have  no  reason  to  doubt  that  they 
reflected  the  pattern  of  growth  which  could  reasonably  be  anticipated  and 
which Mr Morgenstern said was being achieved.  The plaintiffs' experts did 
not dispute his evidence that a carpark operation could expect to incur losses 
in its early years of operation and only gradually build towards profitability. 
[68] It was inevitable then that both GLIMS and GLL, as GLIMS' wholly 
owned  subsidiary,  would  be  reliant  on  the  continuing support of GLIMS' 
shareholders.  Indeed, a note to the  GLIMS  accounts records the agreement 
of shareholders to continue to support the company and ensure that debts are 
paid  when  they  fall  due.   Both Mr  Bosley  and  Mr  Sclater  accepted  that  the 
continuation  of  this  support  was  critical  to  the  survival  of  both  companies.                                                   85  Footnote omitted.    As  previously  noted,  if  such  support  can  reasonably  be  anticipated  if 
required  to  meet  an  obligation,  a  director  will  not  be  in  breach  of  s  136  or 
guilty  of  the  illegitimate  risk-taking  which  would  also  found  liability  under 
s 135. 
[69] As  I  have  already  said,  I  take  the  view  that  Mr  Morgenstern  had 
reasonable  grounds  for  believing  that  income  from  the  carpark  would  be 
sufficient to cover the incentive payment.  Further, he appears to have had no 
reason  to  think  that  shareholder  support  would  not  continue  and  extend,  if 
need  be,  in  the  event  that  GLL  required  assistance  to  meet  its  obligations 
under  the  carpark  deed.    I  do  not  think  the  turn  of  events  which  led  to  the 
judgment     against     GLL     was     reasonably     foreseeable.     I     consider 
Mr Morgenstern had reasonable grounds for believing that income  from the 
carpark would be sufficient to cover the incentive payment.  However, in the 
event  that  support  was  required,  Mr  Morgenstern  was  entitled  to anticipate 
that   GLIMS   would   continue   to   support   GLL   as   it   moved   towards 
profitability.    Indeed,  it  is  clear  that  GLIMS'  shareholders  decision  to 
withdraw  support  from  GLL  stemmed  from  their  belief  that  the  incentive 
payment was not payable. [118] We agree with the Judge that Mr Morgenstern's interpretation of clause 2.9 of 
the carpark deed (that it was unnecessary to insert the words "at market rates" into 
cl 2.9 because of the surrounding provisions of the deed and context) was reasonably 
open  to  him,  especially in  view  of  the  fact  that  it  was  based  on  advice  at  the  time 
from  Kensington  Swan.    In  these  circumstances  there  is  not  sufficient  evidence  to 
hold that Mr Morgenstern was unreasonable to believe that interpretation and that he 
was therefore  in  breach  of  his  duties  under  ss  135  and  136  of  the Act.    It  was  the 
contractual  interpretation  which  made  commercial  sense  because  GLL  could  cover 
its obligation with receipts.86 
[119] Contrary to the liquidators' submissions that the lawyers' advice provided to 
Mr  Morgenstern  supported  the  conclusion  that  he  knew  his  interpretation  was 
unreasonable or was wilfully ignorant, the Kensington Swan letter refers specifically 
to the rental of the carparks at "at the then current market rates" before advising that 
the  incentive  fee will  not  be  payable  if  the  number  of  parks  leased  at  market  rates 
falls below the numbered threshold.  
[120] We also do not accept the liquidator's submission that, because the expected 
revenue for the incentive may have been accounted for in setting the sale price of the 
Axon development, it was not open to Mr Morgenstern reasonably to believe that the 
                                                 86  Vector Gas Ltd v Bay of Plenty Energy Ltd [2010] NZSC 5, [2010] 2 NZLR at [8]–[9].   expected  revenue  was  contingent  on  the  carparks  being  leased  at  market rates.   As 
recognised  by  cl  2.9  itself,  the  fact  that  the  sale  agreement  may  have  assumed  that 
the incentive would be paid does not mean that it necessarily would be. 
[121] As  Mr  Davies  accepted,  it  is  permissible  for  a  director  to  rely  on  an 
expectation of shareholder support if that expectation is reasonable.  It is accordingly 
unnecessary  for  us  to  review  the  case  law  in  this  area  in  the  circumstances  of  this 
case.    Here  the  liquidators  have  made  no  investigation  of  the  initial  willingness  or 
ability of GLIMS's shareholders (who included others as well as Mr Morgenstern) to 
fund  losses  in  an  initial  period  of  loss.    There  is  therefore  no  basis  for  us  to  be 
persuaded  that  the  Judge's  factual  findings  were  erroneous.    The  liquidators' 
arguments concerning reasonableness and timing of GLL's growth from initial losses 
are therefore also academic.   
[122] This cross-appeal is therefore also dismissed. 
Result 
[123] For the reasons given the appeal and cross-appeals are dismissed. 
[124] As  the  respondents  have  been  successful  on  the  principal  appeal,  but  not  on 
the  cross-appeals,  the  first appellant  is  to  pay 90  per  cent  of the  costs  of  the 
respondents for a standard appeal on a band A basis with usual disbursements to be 
fixed by the Registrar.  We certify for two counsel.
