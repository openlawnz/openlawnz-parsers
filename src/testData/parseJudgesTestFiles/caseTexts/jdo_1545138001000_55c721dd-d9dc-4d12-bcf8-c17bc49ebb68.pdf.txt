   [1] The plaintiffs wish to sue, as additional defendants in this proceeding, the 
individual members of the Te Kawerau Ā Maki Iwi (the Iwi).  They do not have access 
to the register of members of the Iwi, and they now apply for pre-commencement 
discovery of that register (or registers) so that they can identify the members and add 
them as parties.  That application is opposed by the second and third defendants, 
against whom the discovery orders are sought. 
[2] An earlier application by the plaintiffs for an order under r 4.24 of the High 
Court Rules appointing the third defendants as the representatives of all affected Iwi 
members was dismissed by Lang J in a judgment delivered on 26 March 2018 (the 
representation judgment).1 
The parties 
[3] The first plaintiff (Tahi) is an Auckland-based incorporated company.  The 
second plaintiff, Ms Lee, is a commercial manager, and she is also the sole shareholder 
and director of Tahi. 
[4] The Iwi is the collective group composed of individuals descended from an 
ancestor of Te Kawerau Ā Maki (as further defined in s 12 of the Te Kawerau Ā Maki 
Claims Settlement Act 2015). 
[5] The first-named first defendant, Mr Taua, is the chairman and rangatira of the 
Iwi.  The second-named first defendant is the executor of the estate of Hariata Arapo 
Ewe (Mrs Ewe), who before her death in August 2009 had been a senior member of 
the Iwi.  Mr Taua and Mrs Ewe had been claimants on behalf of the Iwi in the Iwi's 
claim Wai 470 filed in the Waitangi Tribunal, and they had also been claimants on 
behalf of the Iwi in an urgent Waitangi Tribunal hearing into the Crown's Tāmaki 
Makaurau settlement process (Wai 1362).  Mr Taua had also been claimant on behalf 
of the Iwi in claim Wai 2401 in the Waitangi Tribunal. 
                                                 1  Tahi Enterprises Ltd v Taua [2018] NZHC 516.   [6] The second defendants are the trustees of a charitable trust established by 
Mr Taua on behalf of the Iwi on 13 July 2008, known as the Te Kawerau Iwi Tribal 
Authority  (the Tribal Authority).   The Tribal Authority  was  registered  under  the 
Charitable Trusts Act 2005 on 23 July 2009, for purposes including the negotiation 
and  settlement  of  all  historical  Treaty  of  Waitangi  claims  of  the  Iwi,  and  the 
management of any settlement assets derived therefrom for the benefit of the people 
of the Iwi.  Mr Taua is the chairman of the Tribal Authority.  In this judgment, I will 
refer to the trustees of the Tribal Authority as "the Tribal Authority Trustees". 
[7] The third defendants are the trustees of a trust known as the Te Kawerau Iwi 
Settlement Trust (the Settlement Trust).  The Settlement Trust was established in 
February 2014 for the benefit of the Iwi.  Among the purposes of the Settlement Trust 
was representation of the interests of the Iwi, and the receipt and administration of 
settlement assets received by the Iwi as part of settlement with the Crown of its 
historical Treaty of Waitangi claims.2  Mr Taua is the chairman of the Settlement Trust. 
[8] In this judgment, I will refer to the trustees of the Settlement Trust as "the 
Settlement Trust Trustees". 
[9] Where reference is required to the Tribal Authority Trustees and the Settlement 
Trust Trustees collectively, I will refer to them in this judgment as "the Trustees". 
The plaintiffs' claims 
[10] In their amended statement of claim dated 16 March 2018 ("the March 2018 
claim"), the plaintiffs pleaded six causes of action.  All of them arose out of dealings 
Ms Lee had with members of the Iwi during 2007 and 2008. 
[11] The following description of the plaintiffs' claims is substantially taken from 
the representation judgment. 
                                                 2  The Iwi's historical Treaty of Waitangi claims were settled under the Te Kawerau Ā Maki Claims 
Settlement Act 2015 and the Ngā Mana Whenua O Tāmaki Makaurau Collective Redress Act 
2014.   [12] Four of the causes of action relate to two joint venture agreements said to have 
been made between Tahi and members of the Iwi.  The other two causes of action are 
based on transactions between Ms Lee and Mr Taua relating to a house property 
situated at 517 Oruarangi Road, Mangere (the Mangere property). 
[13] The first of the two joint venture agreements pleaded by the plaintiffs was dated 
27 June 2007 (the 2007 Agreement).  The named parties to the 2007 Agreement were 
Tahi and "Te Kawerau Ā Maki".  Ms Lee signed the document for Tahi, and Mr Taua 
and Ms Piki Taylor for Te Kawerau Ā Maki.  Under the 2007 Agreement, Tahi agreed 
to provide funding of up to $2 million "in support of Te Kawerau's Treaty claims 
process".  Tahi was required to pay $1 million within three working days of execution 
of the agreement, and the balance of the money was to be paid "within 2 months after 
signing of the Agreement in Principal with the Crown". 
[14] In consideration for receiving these sums, Te Kawerau agreed that Tahi would 
be the Iwi's exclusive partner in all future joint venture developments.  Any profits 
from those undertakings would be shared as to 65 per cent by Te Kawerau and 35 per 
cent by Tahi. 
[15] The second joint venture agreement (the Variation Agreement) was signed on 
22 July 2008, and it purported to vary the 2007 Agreement.  The parties were the same, 
and the signatories were Ms Lee on behalf of Tahi and Mr Taua and Mrs Ewe on behalf 
of Te Kawerau.  The Variation Agreement recorded that Mr Taua and Mrs Ewe had 
"authority to sign this agreement on behalf of Te Kawerau". 
[16] Under  the Variation Agreement,  Te Kawerau Ā  Maki  was  defined  as 
"Te Kawerau Ā Maki Iwi Tribal Authority".  The agreement confirmed that that group 
comprised: (i) The collective group comprised of persons: 
(a) Who descend from the following ancestors: 
i. Tawhia ki te Rangi (also known as Te Kawerau Ā 
Maki); and 
ii. Mana; and   iii. Te Au o Te Whenua; and 
iv. Kowhatu ki te Uru. 
(ii) Every whanau, hapu or group of persons to the extent that the whanau, 
hapu or group includes persons referred to in 4.i and 
(iii) Every person referred to in clause 4.i. [17] In addition, the Variation Agreement contained the following clause: It is reasonably foreseeable that upon the successful settlement of the Treaty 
Claims with the Crown, Te Kawerau will use or form various entities ("related 
entities") that are associated or controlled by Te Kawerau to govern, manage 
and develop all assets being settled.  Both parties agree that this agreement 
should also be binding on all those related entities. [18] Under the Variation Agreement, Tahi agreed to "provide total funding up to and 
not exceeding NZ$2 million ... in support of the Te Kawerau's Treaty claims process".  
The parties acknowledge that Tahi had already paid the $1 million.  The balance was 
to be paid in instalments of $200,000, $100,000 and $700,000, on the occurrence of 
specified events during the treaty claims settlement process. 
[19] A new provision (not present in the 2007 Agreement) required Te Kawerau to 
repay the sums paid by Tahi, in accordance with the following clause: 13. As  soon  as  Te Kawerau  or  any  related  entities  receive  any  cash 
settlement (including and not limited to accumulated rentals related to 
Crown Forest Licences) from the Crown of not less than $2 million, 
Te Kawerau agrees to ensure the prompt repayment of the sum of 
$2 million capital back to Tahi Enterprises.  Payment to be made 
within 2 months of receipt. [20] The Variation Agreement reiterated that all profits and interests arising from 
"future business endeavours" were to be shared as to 65 per cent to Te Kawerau and 
35 per cent to Tahi.  It also recorded that, save as varied by the Variation Agreement, 
the 2007 Agreement was to remain in full force and effect. 
[21] For  convenience,  I  will  refer  to  the  2007  Agreement  and the  Variation 
Agreement together as "the Agreements". 
[22] The  plaintiffs  allege  that  the  Tribal  Authority Trustees entered  into  an 
agreement with the Crown on 7 August 2008 setting out the terms of negotiation of   the Iwi's treaty claims.  They say that on 5 September 2008 Tahi paid $200,000 into a 
bank account nominated by Mr Taua in accordance with the Variation Agreement, and 
a further $100,000 (into the same account) in October 2008. 
[23] On 12 February 2010 the Crown and the Iwi entered into a written agreement 
in principle to settle the Iwi's treaty claims.  And on 22 February 2014 the Crown 
entered into a deed of settlement with Te Kawerau Ā Maki and the Settlement Trust 
Trustees, setting out the terms for settlement of the Iwi's treaty claims. 
[24] The Te Kawerau Ā Maki Claims Settlement Act 2015 came into force on 
15 September 2015.  Under this Act, the Iwi's treaty claims were settled on the basis 
that the Crown would transfer nominated properties to the Settlement Trust Trustees 
and would also make certain payments to them.  In addition, the Crown granted the 
Settlement Trust Trustees the option to purchase several parcels of land, and the right 
of first refusal to purchase other parcels of land. 
[25] Under the Ngā Mana Whenua O Tāmaki Makaurau Collective Redress Act 
2014 (the Redress Act), Te Kawerau Ā Maki and 12 other iwi/hapu were collectively 
granted certain rights and interests by way of redress for historical treaty breaches by 
the Crown.  These included the ownership of certain parcels of land and the right to 
purchase other land. 
[26] By letter dated 27 September 2006 the solicitors acting for Te Kawerau Ā 
Maki, the Tribal Authority Trustees and Mr Taua purported to cancel the Agreements.  
Tahi and Ms Lee then filed the present proceeding. 
[27] The plaintiffs' fifth and sixth causes of action relate to the Mangere property 
which was acquired by Ms Lee in January 2008.  The plaintiffs say that Mr Taua has 
resided in the Mangere property throughout the period with which the proceeding is 
concerned.  Ms Lee contends that Mr Taua told her the Iwi had agreed to give him a 
sum equivalent in value to at least four per cent of any assets received from the treaty 
settlement, and that he agreed to assign to her his right to receive that share of the 
treaty settlement assets in return for the transfer of the Mangere property to him as 
soon as she received those assets.  Ms Lee entered into a further agreement with   Mr Taua, under which she leased the Mangere property to him for $360.00 per week.  
She says that in May 2011 the parties renewed the tenancy agreement and Mr Taua 
agreed to pay rent in the sum of $400.00 per week. 
[28] Ms Lee says that she never received the share of the treaty settlement assets 
Mr Taua purported to assign to her.  In her fifth cause of action, she seeks an order 
requiring the Iwi, the Tribal Authority Trustees and/or the Settlement Trust Trustees to 
perform the agreement or pay damages in lieu of specific performance.  Ms Lee also 
alleges that Mr Taua is now significantly in arrears with the rental payable for the 
Mangere property.  In the sixth cause of action, she seeks judgment against Mr Taua 
for the unpaid rental. 
The representation judgment 
[29] In the representation judgment, Lang J noted that the Crown dealt with the Iwi 
as a group in settling the treaty claims, and that the Settlement Trust Trustees now hold 
the treaty settlement assets for the benefit of that group.  His Honour also noted that 
the Settlement Trust Trustees maintain a current register of members of the Iwi who 
are beneficiaries of the settlement.  His Honour therefore proceeded on the assumption 
that it would be possible to identify the persons whom it was proposed the Settlement 
Trust Trustees would represent.  They would be the persons listed on the register held 
by the Settlement Trust Trustees, who were older than 18 as at 27 June 2007.  The 
Judge noted counsel's advice that there would be approximately 400 such persons.3 
[30] In dismissing the application for a representation order, Lang J made a number 
of observations.  First, His Honour noted that the statement of claim did not specify 
the precise basis on which the plaintiffs alleged the Te Kawerau signatories signed the 
Agreements as the authorised agents of the Iwi.  However, during the hearing counsel 
for the plaintiffs confirmed that the plaintiffs would allege that the signatories had 
actual authority of all members of the Iwi to sign the Agreements on their behalf.  His 
Honour noted that that would require the plaintiffs to prove that each member of the 
Iwi knew of the proposed venture and authorised the Te Kawerau signatories to sign 
the Agreements on their behalf. 
                                                 3  At [40]-[41].   [31] His Honour then noted that each member of the Iwi would be entitled to defend 
the claim on the basis that he or she did not know of the proposed joint venture and/or 
did not authorise the Te Kawerau signatories to sign the 2007 Agreement and/or the 
Variation Agreement on his or her behalf.  The positions of individual members would 
differ according to the extent to which they were aware of what was occurring in 2007 
and 2008, and common sense suggested that it was likely that some Iwi members 
would have no knowledge of the negotiations with Ms Lee.  In those circumstances, 
His Honour did not consider it appropriate to require the Settlement Trust Trustees to 
be responsible for ensuring the interests of all members of the Iwi were properly 
protected.  The Settlement Trust Trustees could not be expected to know or make 
enquiries as to whether individual Iwi members had sufficient knowledge of the 
proposal to give their informed consent to those who would sign the agreements on 
their behalf. 
[32] Lang J did not consider the making of a representation order would serve the 
usual purpose of removing the need for a multiplicity of proceedings.  His Honour said 
that  the  plaintiffs  can  proceed  against  members  of  the  Iwi  by  adding  them  as 
respondents and arranging for them to be served.  The learned Judge said:4 The scope of the evidence the plaintiffs will be required to adduce at trial will 
also remain the same because they have no option now but to prove that each 
member  of  the  Iwi  authorised  Te Kawerau  signatories  to  sign [the 
Agreements]. [33] Lang J recorded the plaintiffs' proposal that the Settlement Trust Trustees be 
directed to serve copies of all documents and minutes from the proceeding on all 
members of the Iwi currently shown on the register as being more than 18 years of age 
as at 27 June 2007.  The Judge considered that the same amount of administrative 
effort would be required to do that as would be the case if the Iwi members were named 
as respondents.  The only difference was that the burden of that effort would shift from 
the plaintiffs to the Settlement Trust Trustees.  His Honour did not see that procedure 
as achieving any overall economy of effort or expense.5 
                                                 4  At [50]. 5  At [51].   [34] Lang J noted that the position might have been different if the plaintiffs had 
relied upon the status of the signatories to the Agreements as cloaking them with 
implied authority to bind individual members.  In that event it might be possible to 
establish  an  agency  relationship  regardless  of  the  state  of  knowledge  held  by 
individual members of the Iwi.  But on the pleadings as they stood, the plaintiffs were 
not alleging agency based on implied authority.  Nor was there any evidence to support 
any such implied authority. 
The March 2018 claim 
[35] The hearing of the application for representation orders took place on 26 and 
27 February 2018.  Lang J reserved his decision.  Before the representation judgment 
was delivered, the plaintiffs filed the March 2018 claim. 
[36] It is not necessary to refer to this document in detail, as the hearing before me 
proceeded on the basis of a draft second amended statement of claim dated 3 July 2018 
(the  Draft  Claim), in  which  the  individual  Iwi  members,  when  their  names  and 
addresses were known, would be named as defendants.  However, I will summarise 
the March 2018 claim briefly, as it is the pleading to which the Trustees responded in 
their statements of defence filed on 11 June 2018. 
[37] The March 2018 claim pleaded the Agreements, and it pleaded that Mr Taua 
and Ms Piki Taylor  executed  the  2007 Agreement  with  the  authority  of  the  Iwi 
members, as agents of the Iwi members and/or as trustees of the Iwi.  It went on to 
plead that Mr Taua and Ms Taylor had the authority of the Iwi members to manage the 
Iwi's interests under the 2007 Agreement, and that Mr Taua confirmed that the 2007 
Agreement was binding on the Iwi (or members of Te Kawerau Ā Maki). 
[38] The March 2018 claim stated that Mr Taua and Mrs Ewe had the authority of 
the Iwi members to execute the Variation Agreement, and that they did so "as agents 
of the Iwi members and/or as trustees for Te Kawerau Ā Maki".  Mr Taua was said to 
have executed the Variation Agreement as the agent of the Tribal Authority, and to 
have had authority to do so (and to manage the Tribal Authority's interests under the 
Agreements).   [39] The March 2018 claim pleaded that Tahi made the first three payments to the 
Iwi  parties  under  the  2007  Agreement  as  varied  by the  Variation  Agreement:  
$1 million  on  29 June  2007,  $200,000  on  5 September  2008,  and  $100,000  on 
2 October 2008.  The plaintiffs say that these funds were held by the recipients for the 
benefit of the Iwi, and were used by some or all of the defendants to assist with 
advancing the Iwi's claims under the Treaty of Waitangi. 
[40] The  March  2018  claim  pleaded  the  four  causes  of  action  relating  to  the 
Agreements that were referred to in the representation judgment.  The first cause of 
action pleaded breach of the joint venture agreement as varied.  On it, Tahi sought 
specific performance or damages in lieu of specific performance.  In the second cause 
of action, pleaded in the alternative to the first cause of action, Tahi alleged unjust 
enrichment and/or entitlement to compensation in equity (in case the Court should 
hold that the Agreements are not enforceable according to their terms). 
[41] In  the third  cause  of action,  said  to  be  "against  the Iwi  (all  members  of 
Te Kawerau Ā Maki)" Tahi asked for an order charging the interest of the Iwi in the 
Settlement Assets and the earnings from those assets held by the first defendants, the 
Iwi members and the Trustees for the benefit of the Iwi.  The cause of action was said 
to arise out of Tahi's alleged entitlement, as a creditor of the trustees, to be subrogated 
to their various rights of indemnity out of trust assets held by the trusts. 
[42] In the fourth cause of action, against the Tribal Authority Trustees and the 
Settlement Trust Trustees, Tahi sought an injunction restraining "unjust use of the 
settlement assets" inconsistently with the Agreements. 
[43] The final two causes of action were concerned with Ms Lee's claims against 
Mr Taua relating to the Mangere property.  In the fifth cause of action, Ms Lee sought 
specific performance (or damages in lieu thereof), from members of Te Kawerau Ā 
Maki, the Tribal Authority Trustees, and the Settlement Trust Trustees. 
[44] In the sixth cause of action, Ms Lee sought damages and an order for specific 
performance  against  Mr Taua,  relating  to  the  alleged  breaches  by  him  of  his 
obligations under the agreements relating to the Mangere property.   Statements of defence to the March 2018 claim by the Tribal Authority Trustees 
and the Settlement Trust Trustees 
The Tribal Authority Trustees' defence 
[45] The Tribal Authority Trustees note that the  2007 Agreement was  entitled 
"Heads of Joint Venture Agreement", and it recorded that one of the parties was 
"Te Kawerau A Maki".  They plead that "Te Kawerau A Maki" was not and is not a 
legal entity.  They also plead that as trustees (of the Tribal Authority) they can only act 
unanimously, and that at no time have they ever unanimously novated, adopted or 
ratified  the  2007 Agreement  as  varied  by the  Variation Agreement.    The Tribal 
Authority  Trustees further contend that  the  2007  Agreement  (as  so  varied)  is 
unenforceable because it is champertous and/or void for uncertainty, or because it has 
been validly cancelled. 
[46] In response to a pleading in the March 2018 claim that Mr Taua and Ms Taylor 
had the authority of Iwi members to execute the 2007 Agreement, the Tribal Authority 
Trustees deny the allegation and plead: They say further that, while the first defendants had the authority to represent 
Iwi members, they did not, and could not, have the authority to contract for 
such Iwi members, and Tahi knew, or, on enquiry – as would have been 
reasonable for a person in the shoes of Tahi – should have known this. [47] They make a similar response to the plaintiffs' allegations directed to the 
Variation Agreement. 
[48] The Tribal Authority Trustees contend that it is not legally possible for a person 
to be a trustee of an Iwi, and that neither Mr Taua nor Ms Taylor had authority as agent 
to contract on behalf of the members of the Iwi to pledge their credit or incur liabilities 
on their behalves. 
[49] In respect of the Variation Agreement, the Tribal Authority Trustees repeat the 
contention that Te Kawerau Ā Maki was and is not an entity capable of contracting.  
They acknowledge that the Tribal Authority did exist as at the date of the Variation 
Agreement, but say that Tahi elected not to invite the-then Tribal Authority Trustees   to participate in the variation.  They deny that the-then Tribal Authority Trustees were 
parties to the Variation Agreement. 
[50] In their first affirmative defence, the Tribal Authority Trustees contend that the 
Agreements were illegal.  They say that the plaintiffs had no prior interest in the Iwi's 
Waitangi Tribunal claims, and that the Agreements, if enforced, would entitle Tahi to 
a 35 per cent share of future profits generated from the development of any settlement 
assets ad infinitum, and that any returned (settlement) assets could only thereafter be 
developed with Tahi, to the exclusion of all others.  The Agreements, if enforced, 
would also (i) enforce the assignment to Tahi of four per cent of the assets returned to 
the Iwi, and (ii) render a group of individuals (Iwi members) who did not sign the 
Agreements personally  liable  in  damages  to  Tahi.    In  those  circumstances,  the 
enforcement of the Agreements would be contrary to public policy. 
[51] The Tribal Authority Trustees' second alternative defence pleads entitlement to 
cancel the Agreements because of Tahi's failure to make timely payment of the final 
payment of $700,000 that was payable under the Agreements within four months of 
the full ratification of the Deed of Settlement in Parliament.  They say that Ms Lee 
told Mr Taua on or about 28 December 2012 that Tahi would not pay the $700,000. 
[52] The Tribal Authority Trustees' third and fourth affirmative defences also rely 
on alleged entitlement to cancel the Agreements.  The third affirmative defence pleads 
certain alleged misrepresentations made to Mr Taua by Mr Tuku Morgan on behalf of 
Ms Lee.  The fourth affirmative defence alleges certain breaches of an alleged duty on 
the  plaintiffs  to  act  in  good  faith  in  their  dealings  with  the  defendants.   These 
allegations all appear  to  be  directed  at  certain  activities  of  Ms Lee's  husband, 
Mr Martin Li, who was a director of Tahi. 
The Settlement Trust Trustees' defence 
[53] The Settlement Trust Trustees refer to the plaintiffs' pleading that the plaintiffs 
sue them as representatives of Te Kawerau Ā Maki Iwi.  They say that that pleading 
can no longer stand in the light of the representation judgment, which was not the 
subject of appeal or any other challenge.  They further say that they cannot be liable   in their capacities as trustees of the Settlement Trust, because the Settlement Trust was 
not settled until 21 February 2014. 
[54] The Settlement Trust Trustees plead a number of the same defences pleaded by 
the Tribal Authority Trustees, including that the Agreements are champertous and 
unenforceable, and/or void for uncertainty. 
The plaintiffs' replies 
[55] In  their  reply  to  the  Tribal Authority Trustees' statement  of  defence, the 
plaintiffs generally deny the affirmative allegations made against them.  They admit 
that they did not seek confirmation of mandate from the Tribunal Authority Trustees 
(other than Mr Taua), but they say that it was not necessary for them to do so in order 
to legally contract with the Tribunal Authority Trustees. 
[56] They deny that the letter of 27 September 2016 was effective to cancel either 
of the Agreements, and say that there was no basis for the purported cancellation.  They 
deny that the Agreements or either of them was champertous or void for uncertainty. 
[57] They admit that the parties to the Agreements owed each other duties of good 
faith  (arising  from  the  terms  of  the Agreements  and  the  fiduciary  nature  of  the 
relationship), but they deny the allegations that they acted in breach of those duties.  
They say that the matters pleaded by the Tribunal Authority Trustees relating to 
Mr Martin Li are the subject of a full and final settlement agreement entered into 
between Mr Li and the Tribunal Authority Trustees on 20 October 2016. 
[58] In  their  reply  to  the  Settlement Trust Trustees' statement  of  defence,  the 
plaintiffs admit that the Settlement Trust was not settled until 2014, but say the 
Settlement Trust Trustees are not sued as principals to the Agreements.  They admit 
that this Court held (in the representation judgment) that they were not entitled to sue 
the Settlement Trust Trustees as representatives of members of the Iwi, but they deny 
any abuse of process in continuing the claims against the Settlement Trust Trustees, 
saying that their claim will be amended (once the defendants have disclosed the 
register of Iwi members) to make it clear that the Settlement Trust Trustees are no 
longer sued as representatives of Iwi members.   [59] The plaintiffs admit that they have no interest in the Iwi's Treaty claim, and 
that they did not apply to the Waitangi Tribunal or this Court for review of the 
arrangements proposed under the Agreements or under the agreement with Mr Taua 
relating to the Mangere property.  They say that no such application was required. 
[60] They deny the Settlement Trust Trustees' allegations of unlawful maintenance 
or champerty, and they deny that enforcement  of the Agreements or the  alleged 
agreement relating to the Mangere property would be contrary to public policy. 
[61] Otherwise,  the  plaintiffs  generally  deny  the  affirmative  allegations  in  the 
Settlement Trust Trustees' statement of defence. 
The Settlement Trust Trustees' strike-out application 
[62] On  11 June  2018  the  Settlement  Trust Trustees applied  to  strike  out  the 
plaintiffs' claims against them.  They referred to the representation judgment, in which 
the Court had refused the plaintiffs' application to sue them as the representatives of 
the Iwi members, and contended that the March 2018 claim did not plead any viable 
cause of action against them.  In addition, the Settlement Trust Trustees contended that 
the Agreements were illegal and unenforceable, inter alia on the grounds of champerty. 
[63] The plaintiffs filed a notice of opposition to the strike-out application on 
26 June 2018, denying that the Settlement Trust Trustees have been improperly or 
mistakenly joined.  They denied that their claims are champertous, or precluded by the 
representation judgment, and contended that good causes of action have been pleaded 
against the Settlement Trust Trustees.  They contended that their claims could not be 
heard and adjudicated without the Settlement Trust Trustees being parties to the 
proceeding 
The Draft Claim 
[64] The Draft Claim, submitted by Mr Salmon at the hearing before me, contained 
two  blank  schedules.    Schedule 1  would  be  completed  with  the  names  of  "the 
Contracting Iwi Members", being all members of the Iwi who were over 18 years of 
age  at  27 June  2007.    The  Contracting  Iwi  Members  would  become  the  fourth   defendants in the proceeding.  Schedule 2 would be completed with the names of all 
members  of  the  Iwi  from  time  to  time  ("the  Benefitting  Iwi  Members").    The 
Benefitting Iwi Members would become the fifth defendants. 
[65] The Draft Claim alleges that the Contracting Iwi Members were parties to the 
Agreements.  Mr Taua and/or Ms Taylor are said to have had actual authority from the 
Contracting  Iwi  Members  to  execute  the  2007 Agreement  on  their  behalf,  that 
authority being "express or ... to be implied from the authority of the signatories as a 
matter of custom (which custom as a matter of common law will be informed by 
tikanga"). 
[66] The Contracting Iwi Members are also said to have been parties to the Variation 
Agreement:  Mr Taua and/or Mrs Ewe are said to have had authority to enter into the 
Variation Agreement on their behalf.  Again, the authority is said to have been actual 
authority, whether express or implied as a matter of custom/tikanga. 
[67] The plaintiffs then plead that Mr Taua and/or Ms Taylor (in respect of the 2007 
Agreement) and Mr Taua and/or Mrs Ewe (in respect of the Variation Agreement) 
executed  the  Agreements  in  an  additional  capacity,  namely  as  trustees  for  the 
Benefitting Members.  The Contracting Iwi Members are also said to have entered into 
the Agreements as trustees for the Benefitting Iwi Members. 
[68] The plaintiffs further contend that Mr Taua and/or Ms Taylor had the authority 
of  the  Contracting  Iwi  Members  to  manage  the  Iwi's  interests  under  the  2007 
Agreement, and  that  Mr Taua  and/or  Mrs Ewe  had  similar  authority  under the 
Variation Agreement. 
[69] The plaintiffs also say that Mr Taua executed the Variation Agreement as agent 
of the Tribal Authority Trustees, and that in entering into the Variation Agreement the 
Tribal Authority Trustees also became a party to the 2007 Agreement.  They contend 
that Mr Taua also had the authority (actual authority, being either express or implied 
by custom/tikanga) of the Tribal Authority Trustees to manage the Tribal Authority's 
interests under the Agreements.   [70] The plaintiffs say that the $2 million Tahi was to pay under the Agreements 
was to be paid to the Contracting Iwi Members. 
[71] Tahi's third cause of action, in which it seeks to be subrogated to certain 
trustees' rights of indemnity out of trust assets, is now proposed to be made only 
against the Benefitting Iwi Members.  The plaintiffs allege that the first defendants 
and Ms Taylor, the Contracting Iwi Members, the Tribal Authority Trustees, and the 
Settlement Trust Trustees, hold the settlement assets for the Benefitting Iwi Members, 
and to the extent the defendants are liable to Tahi and are entitled to indemnity from 
the settlement assets in respect of that liability, Tahi is entitled to be subrogated to the 
defendants'  indemnity  rights,  and  to  a  charge  on  the  interest  of  the  Benefitting 
Members in the settlement assets. 
[72] The Draft Claim does not contain the fourth cause of action pleaded in the 
March 2018 Claim, in which injunctive relief was sought relating to the use of the 
settlement assets. 
[73] The penultimate cause of action in the Draft Claim is equivalent to the fifth 
cause  of  action  in  the  March  2018  Claim,  in  which  Ms Lee  sought specific 
performance (or damages in lieu) on the alleged agreement with Mr Taua relating to 
the Mangere property (and in particular, her claim that she is entitled to an assignment 
of four per cent of the settlement assets).  This claim is now made by Ms Lee against 
the  Benefitting  Iwi  Members (as  well  as  the  Tribal Authority  Trustees  and  the 
Settlement Trust Trustees). 
[74] The last cause of action in the Draft Claim is Ms Lee's claim against Mr Taua 
for unpaid rent on the Mangere property. 
The plaintiffs' discovery application 
[75] The following orders are sought: (a) Orders under r 8.20(2) (or alternatively under r 8.4(4)) that the [Tribal 
Authority Trustees and the Settlement Trust Trustees] file and serve 
on the [plaintiffs] affidavits stating:   (i) Whether they have or have had in their control registers of 
members of Te Kawerau a Maki, and 
(ii) If any such documents have been but are no longer in their 
control,  their  best  knowledge  and  belief  as  to  when  such 
documents ceased to be in their control and who now has 
control of them; 
(b) Orders under r 8.20(2) (or alternatively under r 8.4(4)) that the [Tribal 
Authority Trustees and the Settlement Trust Trustees] make any such 
documents in their control available for inspection, in accordance with 
r 8.27, to the applicants; 
(c) Such other ancillary orders as the Court deems appropriate; and 
(d) Costs. The Trustees' notice of opposition 
[76] The notice of opposition says: 
(a) That the causes of action pleaded in the Draft Claim are either not 
tenable or are speculative as: 
(i) they depend on the first defendants, Mr Taua and Ms Tamaariki, 
being constituted as the agents of the intended defendants to 
incur liability on their behalves and pledge the personal credit 
of the intended defendants; 
(ii) not all the intended defendants were born, or were over the age 
of 18, at the time one or both of the Agreements were executed; 
(iii) Ms Lee's evidence as to agency deposes that the authority of 
Mr Taua and Mrs Ewe to bind the intended defendants  was 
based on Mr Taua's oral representation to Ms Lee as to that 
authority; 
(iv) the  Agreements  give rise  to  claims  against  the  intended 
defendants  that  are  illegal.    That  is  because  they  are 
champertous and the plaintiffs never applied to the Court for   approval of the funding terms for the advancement of litigation 
against the Crown. 
[77] The Trustees acknowledge that there exists a register of members.  They say it 
is in the custody, power, possession and control of the Tribal Authority Trustees, not 
the Settlement Trust Trustees.  Further, the register does not evidence any "mandate" 
of any of the defendants on behalf of the intended defendants. 
[78] The Trustees also say that personal information held in the register as to the 
names and addresses of Iwi members (the intended defendants) was gathered and held 
with a written statement that the information would be private and was sought for 
certain defined purposes (which did not include later being used by the plaintiffs to 
sue the Iwi members).  That created a reasonable expectation that Iwi members' 
personal details would not be disclosed to third parties without their individual prior 
consents. 
[79] There was one affidavit in opposition, that of Ms Collette Fenton, a secretary 
employed by the solicitors for the Trustees.  Ms Fenton attached a copy of the Tribal 
Authority's membership registration form. 
Do the rules referred to by the plaintiffs confer jurisdiction to make the orders 
sought? 
[80] The plaintiffs relied primarily on r 8.20.  That rule provides: 8.20 Order for particular discovery before proceeding commenced 
(1) This rule applies if it appears to a Judge that— (a) a person (the intending plaintiff) is or may be entitled to 
claim in the court relief against another person (the intended 
defendant) but that it is impossible or impracticable for the 
intending plaintiff to formulate the intending plaintiff's claim 
without  reference  to  1  or  more  documents  or  a  group  of 
documents; and (b) there are grounds to believe that the documents may be or may 
have been in the control of a person (the person) who may or 
may not be the intended defendant. 
(2) The Judge may, on the application of the intending plaintiff made 
before any proceeding is brought, order the person—   (a) to file an affidavit stating— (i) whether  the  documents  are  or  have  been  in  the 
person's control; and (ii) if they have been but are no longer in the person's 
control, the person's best knowledge and belief as to 
when  the  documents  ceased  to  be  in  the  person's 
control and who now has control of them; and 
(b) to serve the affidavit on the intending plaintiff; and 
(c) if the documents are in the person's control, to make those 
documents available for inspection, in accordance with rule 
8.27, to the intending plaintiff. 
(3) An  application  under  subclause  (2)  must  be  by  interlocutory 
application made on notice— 
(a) to the person; and 
(b) to the intended defendant. 
(4) The Judge may not make an order under this rule unless satisfied that 
the order is necessary at the time when the order is made. [81] The application also referred to r 8.4(4).  That subrule provides: 8.4 Initial disclosure 
... 
(4) If a party fails to comply with subclause (1) or (3), a Judge may make 
any of the orders specified in rule 7.48.6 [82] Mr Salmon did not rely on this subrule in his submissions, and I cannot see 
how it could assist the plaintiffs. 
                                                 6  Rule 7.48 materially provides:  7.48 Enforcement of interlocutory order 
(1) If a party (the party in default) fails to comply with an interlocutory order or any requirement 
imposed by or under subpart 1 of Part 7 (case management), a Judge may, subject to any 
express provision of these rules, make any order that the Judge thinks just. 
(2) The Judge may, for example, order— 
(a) that any pleading of the party in default be struck out in whole or in part: 
(b) that judgment be sealed: 
(c) that the proceeding be stayed in whole or in part: 
(d) that the party in default be committed: 
(e) if any property in dispute is in the possession or control of the party in default, that the 
property be sequestered: 
(f) that any fund in dispute be paid into court: 
(g) the appointment of a receiver of any property or of any fund in dispute. 
...   [83] It has not been possible for the plaintiffs to comply with r 8.20(3)(b) which 
requires service  on  the  "intended  defendant"  (in  this  case,  the Contracting  Iwi 
Members and the Benefitting Iwi Members, whose identities the plaintiffs are seeking 
to ascertain).  While the Trustees did not take any point about that in their notice of 
opposition or in Mr Crossland's submissions at the hearing, I later came to the view 
that non-compliance with the service requirement in r 8.20(3)(b) might affect my 
jurisdiction to make an order under the rule.  I accordingly invited counsel to make 
post-hearing  written  submissions  on  the  effect  of  the  service  requirement  in 
r 8.20(3)(b).    Counsel  duly  filed  memoranda,  and  I  have  taken  their  further 
submissions into account in this judgment. 
[84] The plaintiffs did also refer to the Court's inherent jurisdiction, and to the 
House  of  Lords  decision  in Norwich  Pharmacal  Co  v  Customs  &  Excise 
Commissioners, where orders were made against the Commissioners requiring them 
to disclose the names of persons unknown to the intending plaintiff who had been 
unlawfully importing into the UK products that infringed the plaintiff's patent.7  In my 
minute inviting further submissions on the effect of r 8.20(3)(b), I also invited further 
submissions  from  counsel  on one  aspect  of Norwich  Pharmacal and  the  cases 
(primarily in the United Kingdom) that have followed it.  Further submissions on that 
issue have been received and considered. 
The parties' arguments on the issue of jurisdiction under r 8.20 
The plaintiffs 
[85] Counsel submitted that the requirement for service is not mandatory, and 
cannot apply in cases where the purpose of the application is to identify the intended 
defendant. 
[86] Rule 8.20 has its origins in the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction, and in British 
Markitex Ltd and Markitex (New Zealand) Ltd v Johnston Wylie J noted that, however 
sound the reasons for restricting so-called equitable discovery to the somewhat narrow 
                                                 7  Norwich Pharmacal Co v Customs & Excise Commissioners [1974] AC 133 (HL); [1993] UKHL 
6.   confines discussed in Norwich Pharmacal, those limitations have not been imported 
into rr 299 and 301 (the forerunners of the present r 8.20).8 
[87] In response to a reference by the Court to r 8.20(3)(b) appearing to contemplate 
the  intended  defendant  having  a  right  to  be  heard  under  the  rule,  the  plaintiffs 
submitted that it cannot be said that the intended defendants in this case have not had 
the opportunity to exercise that right.  Counsel referred to the representation judgment, 
and also to an exhibit to Ms Lee's affidavit sworn in June 2018, being a public notice 
(dated after the date of the plaintiffs' present application) recording communications 
from the Settlement Trust Trustees to all of the intended additional defendants.  The 
notice is signed by Mr Taua on behalf of the Trustees.  Counsel submitted that, while 
formal service has not occurred, it is inevitable that the Contracting Iwi Members and 
the Benefitting Iwi Members have had notice of the application. 
[88] Alternatively, counsel for the plaintiffs invited me to invoke r 1.6.  That rule 
provides: 1.6 Cases not provided for 
(1) If any case arises for which no form of procedure is prescribed by any 
Act or rules or regulations or by these rules, the court must dispose of 
the  case  as  nearly  as  may  be  practicable  in  accordance  with  the 
provisions of these rules affecting any similar case. 
(2) If there are no such rules, it must be disposed of in the manner that the 
court thinks is best calculated to promote the objective of these rules 
(see rule 1.2). [89] They submitted that, if r 8.20 does not provide jurisdiction in a case where the 
purpose of the application is to identify intended defendants, then the Court is required 
by r 1.6 to dispose of the application as nearly as practicably with the principles 
relating to r 8.20.  They submit that the same outcome results. 
The Trustees 
[90] For the Trustees, counsel submitted that the effect of r 8.20(3)(b) is that the 
rule cannot apply at all to the present application.  They pointed out that the former 
                                                 8  British Markitex Ltd and Markitex (New Zealand) Ltd v Johnston (1987) 2 PRNZ 535 at 540.   r 299  was  amended  in  1993  to  add  the  requirement  of  service on  the  intended 
defendants, and submitted that the authorities decided before the 1993 amendment, 
including British Markitex, are inapplicable.  They acknowledged that the commentary 
on r 8.20 in McGechan on Procedure does suggest that the rule may be used to identify 
the intended defendants, but submitted that the authorities cited in support were all 
cases decided under the old r 299.  The commentary is accordingly inapplicable in 
light of the amendment requiring service. 
[91] Counsel  submitted  that  the  1993 amendment  to  the  rule  represented  a 
conscious change, and the service requirement is expressed in mandatory terms.  The 
result is that, if an intending plaintiff does not know the identity of the intended 
defendant, the intending plaintiff must  have recourse to the Norwich  Pharmacal 
jurisdiction, where a more stringent test for the discovery is required (including a 
higher requirement on the intending plaintiff to show that the intended cause of action 
has merit). 
[92] Counsel  submitted  that  the  application  cannot  be  saved  under  r 1.5 
(non-compliance with the rules) or r 1.6.  The latter rule was designed to avoid 
injustice as a result of technicalities, but the failure to serve in this case cannot be 
considered a technicality.  The plaintiffs have simply used the wrong rule.  That said, 
counsel  acknowledged  that  the  Court  might  consider  curing  the  defect  in  the 
application by treating it as one made under the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction, 
rather than one under r 8.20. 
[93] In response to the plaintiffs' submission that the Contracting Iwi Members and 
the Benefitting Iwi Members have had notice of the application in any event, counsel 
submitted that there is insufficient evidence for the Court to be satisfied that all of 
them were made aware of the application. 
My conclusions on the r 8.20 jurisdiction issue 
[94] I accept the Trustees' submissions on this issue.  Subrule (3) is expressed in 
mandatory terms (for example, in the use of the word "must").  And some purpose 
must  be  given  to  the  1993  amendment,  in  which  the  service  requirement  was   introduced.  Cases decided on the old r 299 as it stood before the 1993 amendment 
cannot assist. 
[95] I  accept  that  the Norwich  Pharmacal jurisdiction  clearly  existed  in 
New Zealand before the 1993 rule change — that is clear from the decision of the 
Court  of Appeal  in Exchange  Commerce  Corp Ltd v  NZ  News  Ltd.9  Somers J 
expressly referred to the jurisdiction in that case, noting that not much difficulty would 
arise in the case of an intending plaintiff who makes it appear that he or she is entitled 
to claim relief against another, but cannot formulate the claim without reference to a 
particular document or class of document.  His Honour said: 10 Not much difficulty can arise in the case of an intending plaintiff who makes 
it appear to the Court that he [or she may be] entitled to claim relief against 
another  but  cannot  formulate [a] claim  without  reference  to  a  particular 
document or class of document.  This must we think embrace circumstances 
where the actual defendant is not known as well as cases where some date, 
figures or other fact or circumstance is necessary in order to plead the claim 
as the rules require.  This part of the rule postulates that the plaintiff has a 
claim but cannot adequately formulate it or name the defendant. 
(Emphasis added.) [96] I do not consider that the 1993 amendment was intended to deprive the Court 
of its equitable jurisdiction, recognised by the Court of Appeal in Exchange Commerce 
Corp, to make Norwich Pharmacal orders where the justice of the case so requires.  
Something more than the mere addition of a service requirement would have been 
expected  if  the  intention  had  been  to  completely  remove  part  of  the  Court's 
jurisdiction.  The effect of the change was, in my view, simply to provide separate 
"tracks" for (i) cases where the identity of the intended defendant was known, but for 
other reasons it was impossible or impracticable for the intending plaintiff to formulate 
its claim (the r 8.20 track), and (ii) cases where the justice of the case required the 
Court in its equitable jurisdiction to intervene, to require someone who has been more 
than a mere witness to the activities of an alleged wrongdoer (whose identity the 
intending plaintiff does not know) to disclose the identity of the alleged wrongdoer 
(the Norwich Pharmacal track). 
                                                 9  Exchange Commerce Corporation Ltd v NZ News Ltd [1987] 2 NZLR 160. 10  At 164.   [97] That is consistent with the view expressed by John Katz QC in an article 
published in the New Zealand Intellectual Property Journal in 2010.11 
[98] For  those  reasons, I  conclude that  the Norwich  Pharmacal jurisdiction  is 
available in New Zealand, but in a case such as this r 8.20 is not.  I will accordingly 
treat this application as one made in the Court's inherent jurisdiction, guided by the 
principles applied by the Courts in Norwich Pharmacal and the cases in which it has 
been followed.  I see no possible prejudice to the Trustees in so doing — Norwich 
Pharmacal was referred to in the application, and both parties presented argument on 
it. 
The Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction 
[99] The so-called "Norwich Pharmacal order" had its origins in the old equitable 
"bill of discovery" procedure, but by the 1970's it appears to have fallen into disuse.  
That may have been because of the existence of the "mere witness" rule, under which 
a person who was no more than a bystander, or "mere witness" to the wrongdoing of 
which the plaintiff complained, could not be compelled to provide discovery by way 
of a pre-trial order designed to identify the wrongdoer. 
[100] In Norwich Pharmacal, the House of Lords held that the "mere witness" rule 
remained in existence, but would not prevent an order against a third party directing 
the third party to disclose the identity of the wrongdoer if the third party had some 
qualifying relationship, or association or connection, with the alleged wrongdoer, 
which created a duty to assist the person who had been wronged by disclosing the 
identity of the wrongdoer.  As Lord Reid put it, an otherwise innocent person who, 
through no fault on its part, becomes "mixed up in" the tortious acts of another, comes 
under a duty to assist the person who has been wronged by disclosing the identity of 
the  wrongdoer.12  In  the  case  before  the  Court  in Norwich  Pharmacal,  the 
Commissioners' statutory powers with respect to the imported goods while the goods 
were  in  Customs'  control  were  considered  sufficient  to  give  rise  to  the  duty  of 
disclosure, notwithstanding that there was no cause of action against Customs itself. 
                                                 11  John Katz, "Norwich Pharmacal Orders:  35 Years On", (2010) NZIPJ 610. 12  Norwich Pharmacal Co v Customs & Excise Commissioners, above n 7, at [175].   [101] Subsequent decisions of the Courts in the United Kingdom have arguably 
lessened the requirement that the respondent to the discovery application must have 
been "mixed up in" the wrongdoing before discovery of the wrongdoer's identity will 
be ordered.  For example, in The Coca Cola Company v British Telecommunications 
Plc Neuberger J  considered  that  Lord  Reid  had  put  the  test  for  association,  or 
connection, with the wrongdoer's activities higher than some of the other law lords 
had done.13  His Honour referred to the speech of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in 
Norwich Pharmacal, where his lordship referred to the respondent having actual 
involvement, or actual concern, in a transaction or arrangement, as a result of which 
the  respondent  acquired  the  information.    Neuberger J  considered  that  the 
"transactions or arrangements" there referred to must be transactions or arrangements 
which are to be the subject matter of the main proceeding.14 
[102] Neuberger J identified the following propositions: 
(i) the intending plaintiff must show that it has or may have a good case 
against the alleged wrongdoer (in some cases an honest belief that a tort 
has been committed may suffice); 
(ii) the respondent must have become mixed up, in some real way, in the 
transaction concerning which the discovery is required; 
(iii) any order made should be made with a view to trying to enable justice 
to be done; 
(iv) the plaintiffs' interests in pursuing their case must be balanced against 
the natural concern of BT not to open the floodgates to a raft of similar 
discovery  applications  (BT  was  merely  the  service  provider  for  a 
mobile  telephone  used  by  the  alleged  wrongdoer  in  the  course  of 
carrying out the alleged unlawful activity (trade mark infringement and 
passing off)). 
                                                 13  The Coca Cola Company v British Telecommunications Plc [1999] FSR 518 at 522. 14  At 522.   [103] Neuberger J was satisfied that the justice of the case justified the making of the 
order sought, notwithstanding the unwitting nature of BT's involvement in the alleged 
unlawful activity. 
[104] The Norwich  Pharmacal jurisdiction was considered again by the  United 
Kingdom Supreme Court in The Rugby Football Union v Consolidated Information 
Systems Ltd.15  The principal judgment, in which all other members of the Court 
concurred, was given by Lord Kerr.  His Lordship noted that the essential purpose of 
the Norwich Pharmacal remedy is to do justice.  That will involve the exercise of the 
discretion by a careful and fair weighing of all relevant factors.  His Lordship noted 
that the following factors have been identified as relevant by the authorities:16 (i) the strength of the possible cause of action contemplated by the 
applicant for the order; 
(ii) the strong public interest in allowing an applicant to vindicate 
his legal rights; 
(iii) whether the making of the order will deter similar wrongdoing 
in the future; 
(iv) whether the information could be obtained from another source; 
(v) whether the respondent to the application knew or ought to have 
known that he was facilitating arguable wrongdoing, or was 
himself a joint tortfeasor; 
(vi) whether the order might reveal the names of innocent persons 
as well as wrongdoers, and if so whether such innocent persons 
will suffer any harm as a result; 
(vii) the degree of confidentiality of the information sought; 
(viii) the privacy rights under art.8 of the European Convention for 
the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of 
the individuals whose identify is to be disclosed; 
(ix) the rights and freedoms under the EU data protection regime of 
the individuals whose identity is to be disclosed; and 
(x) the  public  interest  in  maintaining  the  confidentiality  of 
journalistic sources, as recognised in s 10 of the Contempt of 
Court Act 1981 and art.10 ECHR. 
(Citations omitted.)                                                  15  The Rugby Football Union v Consolidated Information Systems Ltd [2012] UKSC 55; [2013] FSR 
23. 16  At [17].   [105] There appears to be no authority on the application of Norwich Pharmacal in 
this  Court, but I  think the  approach  applied  by  the  Courts  in  New Zealand  to 
applications under r 8.20 must to some extent inform the exercise of the Court's 
Norwich Pharmacal discretion.  For example, it seems to me from some of the earlier 
cases on the old r 299, including Exchange Commerce Corporation Ltd, that the rule 
had its origins in the Norwich Pharmacal line of cases, and that the "is or may be 
entitled to claim" wording in the rule was probably intended to reflect the threshold an 
applicant for a Norwich Pharmacal order was required to meet before a discovery 
order could be made.  It will therefore be appropriate to refer briefly to some of the 
New Zealand authorities on r 8.20. 
The cases decided under r 8.20 
[106] What is required under r 8.20 is that the plaintiff must have a real, as opposed 
to a speculative, claim.  There must be a "sufficient" substratum of fact ... some basis 
of fact which takes matters beyond mere fishing; mere trawling or speculation, hoping 
something useful may be caught.17 
[107] In Welgas Holdings Ltd v Petroleum Corp of NZ Ltd, McGechan J referred to 
the Court of Appeal decision in Exchange Commerce, noting that there must be a 
sufficient  "substratum  of  fact"  to  take  the  application  beyond  a  mere  fishing 
expedition, where the applicant is hoping that something useful may be caught.  His 
Honour considered that the Court in Exchange Commerce was looking for some 
threshold so as to avoid speculative fishing. 
[108] McGechan J considered that a claim that which was "plainly hopeless" would 
not be regarded as one of sufficient substance to justify disclosure, but the Court could 
not generally be expected to reach "any real probability of success" conclusion on an 
interlocutory application such as a pre-commencement discovery application.18  The 
issue is one of substance as opposed to speculation.19 
                                                 17  Welgas Holdings Ltd v Petroleum Corp of NZ Ltd (1991) 3 PRNZ 33 (HC) at 43. 18  At 43. 19  At 50.   [109] In Hetherington Ltd v Carpenter20 the Court of Appeal referred with approval 
to the statement of McGechan J in Welgas that the essential concern in such cases was 
to sort out the real from the fishing, rather than to prejudge the merits of the case at a 
preliminary stage. 
[110] In Hetherington, the Court of Appeal framed the test in the following terms:21 There must be some foundation established such as will make it just that the 
respondents should be put to the trouble and suffer the intrusion on their affairs 
which an order will involve ... but the focus ... is on the probable existence 
of a claim, not on the probability of a claim being established at trial ... the 
Court cannot be intended, at the stage of pre-commencement discovery, to 
reach any conclusion as to the likelihood of ultimate success at trial.  ...  If the 
proposed claim, even if particularised, would be struck out as having no basis 
in law, then clearly discovery should not be granted.  There must be more, 
however, than the mere ability to make allegations which avoid being struck 
out.  Counsel's duty to the Court requires some basis before allegations are 
made and proceedings issued, although the evidence at that stage may be 
insufficient to establish the case. [111] On the issue of what is meant by "impossible or impracticable" in r 8.20, the 
Court of Appeal has held that the words refer to an inability to plead the claim in 
accordance with the requirements of the rules.  It is the formulation of the claim which 
must be impossible or impracticable, not its pursuit to finality.22 
The parties' arguments 
The plaintiffs 
[112] Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted in their post-hearing memorandum that the 
Norwich Pharmacal requirement that the respondent be somehow involved in, or 
"mixed up in", the wrongdoing of the intended defendant simply does not apply where 
the respondent is itself a defendant in an existing proceeding, and the discovery is 
sought for the purpose of identifying additional defendants who will be added in that 
proceeding.23  They submitted that the Court's jurisdiction to make the orders sought, 
exercising the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction, is therefore not constrained by any 
                                                 20  Hetherington Ltd v Carpenter [1997] 1 NZLR 699 at 704. 21  At 704. 22  Exchange  Commerce  Corp  Ltd  v  NZ  News  Ltd,  above  n 9  at  164,  and Hetherington  Ltd  v 
Carpenter, above n 20 at 705. 23  Referring to Norwich Pharmacal Co v Customs & Excise Commissioners, above n 7.   requirement that the Trustees be associated with, or mixed up in, the wrongdoing 
alleged  against  the  Contracting  Iwi  Members  and  the  Benefitting  Iwi  Members 
(although such a requirement would be met in any event — see, for example, the 
plaintiff's first cause of action, where the Tribal Authority Trustees and the Contracting 
Iwi Members are both said to be liable to Tahi for breach of the Agreements). 
[113] In his submissions for the hearing, Mr Salmon pointed out that the Agreements 
were made expressly between Tahi and the Iwi.  The Iwi comprises its membership, 
determined by whakapapa, including collective groups and individuals. 
[114] Mr Salmon referred to the Deed of Settlement between the Iwi, the Settlement 
Trust Trustees, and the Crown, which was given statutory effect by the Te Kawerau Ā 
Maki Claims Settlement Act 2015.  The Deed of Settlement was also an agreement 
entered into by the Iwi through its agents, and it defined the Iwi as comprising its 
membership, determined by whakapapa, including collective groups and individuals.  
The Deed of Settlement purports to bind all members of the Iwi, whether living at the 
time of execution or in the future. 
[115] Mr Salmon submitted that the ability of the Contracting Iwi Members to enter 
into the Agreements through their agents, and the ability of the Contracting Iwi Parties 
to enter into the Agreements as trustees for the Benefitting Iwi Members, is in no 
essential way different from the ability of the Iwi to enter into the Deed of Settlement 
with the Crown.  In both cases, enforceable legal relationships have been created as a 
matter of common law, informed by tikanga. 
[116] Mr Salmon  further  noted  that  Mr Taua  was  a  signatory  to  the Deed of 
Settlement with the Crown, and that he was recorded in it as the mandated negotiator 
for the Iwi in the settlement of its Treaty of Waitangi claims. 
[117] In Mr Salmon's submission, the claims involve straightforward application of 
contract  law  to  the Agreements.    The  "substratum  of  fact"  establishes  the  "real   probability of the existence of a claim against" Contracting Iwi Members, and any 
dispute about the extent of any signatories' authority is a matter for trial.24 
[118] Mr Salmon submitted that it must have been the case that the Contracting Iwi 
Members entered into the Agreements as trustees for the Benefitting Iwi Members.  
That must have been so, as the historical Treaty claims were collective, and the Deed 
of Settlement with  the  Crown  binds  future  members  of  the  Iwi.   The  Deed  of 
Settlement was signed "for and on behalf of Te Kawerau Ā Maki" by mandated 
signatories, and those signatories must have signed as agents of the members of the 
Iwi having legal capacity at that time.  In turn, those members thereby entered into the 
Deed of Settlement as trustees for all present and future members of the Iwi.  Those 
considerations apply equally to the Agreements. 
[119] On  the  proposed  joinder  of  the  Benefitting  Iwi  Members,  Mr Salmon 
submitted  that,  where  a  third  party  claimant issues  a  proceeding seeking to  be 
subrogated to a trustee's right of indemnity out of trust assets, the trust beneficiaries 
should be joined.  That is because the claim will seek direct enforcement against trust 
property without recourse to the trustee.25  In this case, the subrogation claim is based 
on a straightforward application of the Agreements with reference to appropriate legal 
principles. 
[120] With reference to Ms Lee's claims relating to the Mangere property, and the 
assignment of Mr Taua's four per cent interest in the settlement assets to Ms Lee, 
Ms Lee seeks to enforce her claim to the four per cent interest against those who 
currently hold the settlement assets legally and beneficially.  Mr Salmon noted that the 
settlement assets are now held by the Tribal Authority Trustees and the Settlement 
                                                 24  To the extent that, contrary to his principal submission, the authority issue may be a relevant 
consideration on the present application, Mr Salmon pointed to the form and content of the 
Agreements (which on their face are agreements between Tahi and the Iwi), Tahi's performance of 
its obligations under the Agreements for the benefit of the Contracting Iwi Members, the Iwi's 
history of entering into collectively binding agreements through agents, the New Zealand common 
law's recognition of tikanga (in Takamore v Clarke [2011] NZCA 587; Takamore v Clarke [2012] 
NZSC 116), and the Court's recognition of the ability of rangatira and kaumatua to act on behalf 
of, and to represent, collective groups (Proprietors of Wakatu v Attorney-General [2017] NZSC 
17, per Elias CJ at [494], per Glazebrooke J at [673], per Arnold and O'Regan JJ at [807]; Ngati 
Apa Ki Te Waipounamu Trust v Attorney-General [2007] 2 NZLR 80 (PC)). 25  Referring to Lynton Tucker, Nicholas Le Poidevin, James Brightwell Lewin on Trusts (19th ed, 
Thomson Reuters, Wellington, 2018) at [21-053].   Trust Trustees for the benefit of the Benefitting Iwi Members.  Again, Mr Salmon 
submits that the claim involves a straightforward application of the law relating to 
assignments, and is enforceable by Ms Lee under s 130 of the Property Law Act 1952. 
[121] On the issue of the plaintiffs' inability to formulate their claims against the 
Contracting Iwi Members and the Benefitting Iwi Members, Mr Salmon submitted 
that the test is obviously met.  The plaintiffs are unable to formulate claims against 
people whose identities they do not know.  Pre-commencement discovery orders can 
and should be made to disclose the names and addresses of prospective defendants.26 
[122] Mr Salmon noted that it is not disputed that the register of Iwi members exists, 
and is in the possession and control of either or both of the Tribal Authority Trustees 
and the Settlement Trust Trustees. 
[123] On the issue of agency, Mr Salmon emphasised that the plaintiffs rely on 
alleged actual authority to bind the Contracting Iwi Members, including authority 
arising from the status of the signatories as rangatira and kaumatua of the Iwi.  To the 
extent  that  any  of  the  Benefitting  Iwi  Members  may  be  minors,  or  otherwise 
incapacitated, appropriate arrangements can be made under the rules for their defence 
of the proceeding.  But at this stage those matters are academic, as there is no evidence 
of the ages of the members who would be sued, nor of any having other disabilities. 
[124] Mr Salmon submitted that the champerty argument is novel in this situation.  
The Agreements did not relate to pursuing litigation in the Courts:  they referred to 
claims before the Waitangi Tribunal, which is a commission of enquiry.  The Waitangi 
Tribunal does not award damages, and accordingly no issue arises over the validity of 
an agreement to divide the spoils of litigation.  Champerty is concerned with the due 
and proper administration of Court business, and the settlement of Treaty Claims is 
not Court business but Crown business.  Further, the Supreme Court has rejected the 
proposition that it is the role of the Courts to act as general regulators of litigation 
funding arrangements.27  In this case, the Agreements did not involve the assignment 
                                                 26  Norwich Pharmacal Co v Customs & Excise Commissioners, above n 7. 27  Waterhouse v Contractors Bonding Ltd [2014] 1 NZLR 91; [2013] NZSC 89.   of any causes of action, and no right was conferred on Tahi to exercise control over 
the Iwi's pursuit of its Treaty claims. 
[125] In any event, even if the Agreements were found to be champertous that would 
not deprive the  plaintiffs of a cause of action.  Under s 76 of the  Contract and 
Commercial Law Act 2017, it would only go to the relief available. 
[126] On the issue of the entitlement of individual Iwi members to privacy, the 
plaintiffs say that privacy concerns cannot be sufficient reason to withhold discovery 
of the identities of the proposed additional defendants.  Privacy Principle 11, in s 6 of 
the Privacy Act 1993, specifically provides for disclosure of personal information for 
the purposes of proceedings before a court. 
The Trustees 
[127] In his post-hearing memorandum, Mr Crossland took the plaintiffs' argument 
on the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction to be that the jurisdiction is limited to cases 
where the person required to provide discovery is a non-party to the proceeding (or 
proposed proceeding).  He submitted that that proposition is incorrect.28  He then went 
on to consider the Draft Claim, and submitted that no wrongdoing by the Contracting 
Iwi Members or the Benefitting Iwi Members is sufficiently pleaded.  No evidence has 
been  provided  to  show  that  Mr Taua  had  express  authority  to  enter  into  the 
Agreements, and the claims based on implied authority are speculative or nebulous.  
The claims against the Contracting Iwi Members that they have been unjustly enriched 
cannot succeed, as they have not benefitted personally from the disputed funds, and 
beneficial receipt is a required element of the cause of action in restitution. 
[128] In respect of the Benefitting Iwi Members, Mr Crossland first submitted that 
there can be no claim against them in "subrogation":  subrogation is not a wrongdoing, 
but a form of relief.  Nor can Ms Lee possibly succeed against the Benefitting Iwi 
Members on the claim that there has been a failure to pay her the four per cent of the 
Settlement Assets which she says was promised to her by Mr Taua.  The Settlement 
Assets are not held by the Benefitting Iwi Members:  they are held by the Settlement 
                                                 28  Referring to Wobben Properties GmbH v Siemens Plc [2014] EWHC 3173 at [25].   Trust Trustees,  and  the  Benefitting  Iwi  Members  have  no  ability  to  compel  the 
Settlement Trust Trustees to make the payment claimed by Ms Lee. 
[129] In his submissions for the hearing, Mr Crossland submitted that the critical 
element affecting all of the causes of action against the proposed additional defendants 
is  the absence of any authority in Mr Taua, Ms Taylor and Mrs Ewe to bind all 
members of the Iwi.  It was not enough for Mr Taua to tell Ms Lee that he had the 
necessary authority.  Mr Taua may have been rangatira of the Iwi, but the plaintiffs 
have provided no particulars and provided no evidence of any customary right of a 
rangatira to alienate an iwi's property rights. 
[130] Further, such evidence as has been provided is against the theory that only one 
person could "call the shots" as Mr Taua purported to do when he claimed to have 
authority to enter into the Agreements on behalf of the Iwi.  The treaty settlement 
process entered into with the Crown shows that numerous people were involved on 
behalf  of  the  Iwi — indeed,  approximately  150  "other  witnesses/members  of 
Te Kawerau Ā Maki who support the settlement" signed the Deed of Settlement. 
[131] Mr Crossland referred to a number of Waitangi Tribunal reports, including the 
1996 Taranaki Report which he submitted raised similar issues to those raised in this 
case.  The question there was whether individuals could presume to alienate Māori 
land, or whether a collective decision of the relevant iwi was required.  The Tribunal 
considered that any disposition that could introduce outsiders to the iwi community 
affected everyone; accordingly, a community decision was required, as expressed 
through the rangatira. 
[132] Consistent with that approach, Mr Crossland submitted that it would be very 
odd  if  a  senior  figure  of  an  iwi  could,  without  any  discussion  within  the iwi 
community, alienate four per cent of the iwi's settlement assets and grant 35 per cent 
control of its profits going forward.  There was and is no chiefly authority over the 
private property interests of members of a given iwi, and a chief cannot pledge the 
personal credit of members without their express authority and consent.  Furthermore, 
the Settlement Trust trust deed provided that, subject to the provisions of the Deed, the 
Settlement Trust Trustees are to control and supervise the business and affairs of the   Settlement Trust in such manner as they in their sole discretion see fit.29  And cl 13.12 
of the same Deed provides for voting procedures to deal with the Settlement Trust 
property.  Similarly the Tribal Authority trust deed, which was executed nine days 
before the Variation Agreement, was signed by seven initial trustees, who had full 
power in respect of the trust fund. 
[133] These documents, and the mandate procedure required by the Crown before 
the Iwi's treaty claims could be settled, are inconsistent with Mr Taua having the 
authority to bind individual Iwi members for which the plaintiffs contend. 
[134] Mr Crossland then referred to the Privacy Act 1993, noting that the Tribal 
Authority and the Settlement Trust qualify as "agencies" subject to that Act, and that 
the information sought is "personal information" as defined in s 2.  When Iwi members 
registered  their  names  and  addresses,  they  did  so  on  a  form  that  contained  the 
following: Privacy of Information 
• The information supplied is confidential within the terms of the Privacy 
Act 1993, and for the lawful use of the Te Kawerau Iwi Tribal Authority. 
• A person may only access their own personal information. [135] In circumstances where the plaintiffs' claims are speculative, and disclosure 
could  chill  tangata  whenua  registering  with  iwi  authorities  (leading  to  less 
participation in elections, and hindering the development of whakapapa records), 
allowing the discovery sought would be contrary to the public interest.  For those 
reasons, there is no justification for abrogating Iwi members' entitlement to privacy in 
this case. 
[136] If those submissions are not accepted, Mr Crossland submitted that it was 
responsible for the Trustees to decline to supply the register without a Court order.  It 
the Court does order production, it should therefore do so without any order for costs.  
Also, a person's address is not required by a litigant to formulate a claim:  if the Court 
                                                 29  At cl 3.7.   orders production of the register it should order the redaction of both the names of all 
Iwi members aged under 18 on 27 June 2007, and the addresses of all Iwi members. 
[137] On the cause of action in which Tahi seeks to be subrogated to the Trustees' 
rights  to  indemnity  out  of  trust  assets,  Mr Crossland initially submitted that 
subrogation is a form of relief, and the cause of action is merely parasitic on the first 
cause of action.  He noted in his written submissions that the Court held in the 
representation judgment that "the issue of subrogation will necessarily be considered 
in the context of relief that the Court may grant after the Court has made its primary 
findings in relation to the issue of liability".30  And to the extent this cause of action 
seeks a charge on the settlement assets, Mr Crossland noted that they are held by the 
Settlement Trust Trustees, who are the legal owners.  Even if there existed a cause of 
action called subrogation, the charge sought would be otiose to the Iwi members.  In 
those circumstances, it is unnecessary to know the names of the people on the register, 
as the claim was only properly pleaded against the Trustees.  In Mr Crossland's 
submission, this cause of action should be struck out, and the Court should do that of 
its own motion. 
[138] At the hearing, Mr Crossland acknowledged that it is a general principle of 
trust law that trustees (such as the Trustees) acting within their powers under the 
relevant trust instruments are entitled to indemnity out of the trust assets for any 
personal liabilities they incur while so acting.  He indicated that the denial of that right 
in his clients' statements of defence would be amended to admit that general right of 
indemnity.  However, he maintained the submission that the courts will not join trust 
beneficiaries in a claim by a creditor of the trustee seeking to enforce a charge over 
trust  assets,  unless  such  joinder  is  necessary  (for  example,  where  the  trustee  is 
bankrupt or cannot be found).  In this case, judgment against the Benefitting Iwi 
Members is not necessary, because they do not hold legal ownership of the trust assets 
and the trustees are available to be sued (and have been sued). 
[139] On the fourth cause of action in the Draft Claim, Mr Crossland noted that the 
settlement assets were owned by the Crown at the time of the purported assignment of 
                                                 30  Tahi Enterprises Ltd v Taua, above n 1, at [46].   four per cent of those assets by Mr Taua to Ms Lee.  The relief sought on this cause of 
action is an order for specific performance (or damages in lieu) against all members 
of the Iwi.  The relief sought accordingly contemplates that the Iwi members would 
be ordered to transfer four per cent of the settlement assets to Ms Lee, even though 
they do not own the settlement assets:  they are only beneficiaries under the Settlement 
Trust, with no power of disposition.  They could not force the Settlement Trust 
Trustees to do anything.  It is unimaginable in those circumstances that a Court would 
order individual members of the Iwi to pay damages if the Settlement Trust Trustees 
did not transfer four per cent of the settlement assets to Ms Lee (even if the claim were 
viable against the Settlement Trust Trustees, who were not parties to the assignment 
on which Ms Lee relies). 
[140] In the representation judgment, the Court held that there was no need for the 
Settlement Trust Trustees to represent Iwi members in relation to this cause of action.  
The  plaintiffs  have  not  appealed  the  representation  judgment, and  they are  now 
estopped from contending that this cause of action may be continued against the 
Benefitting Iwi Members.  Nor does the last cause of action in the Draft Claim, relating 
to Ms Lee's claims against Mr Taua for unpaid rent on the Mangere property, affect 
the Contracting Iwi Members or the Benefitting Iwi Members.  There is accordingly 
no claim to be formulated against the Iwi members on the plaintiffs' last two causes of 
action in the Draft Claim, and disclosure of the register of members for those causes 
of action is unnecessary. 
[141] Mr Crossland briefly addressed the defences of maintenance and champerty in 
his written submissions, while submitting that argument on that issue might better be 
heard in the context of the strike-out application filed by the Settlement Trust Trustees.  
He noted that if the maintenance/champerty argument is upheld, and the Agreements 
are illegal, there would be no claims against the defendants (or the Iwi members). 
[142] He submitted that it remains the law in New Zealand that, as between the 
maintainer and the maintained in litigation, champertous agreements are illegal.31  He 
rejected the distinction the plaintiffs seek to draw between litigation in Court (where 
                                                 31  Stephen Todd The Law of Torts in New Zealand (7th ed, Wellington, 2016) at [18.4.01], Saunders 
v Houghton [2009] NZCA 610, [2010] 3 NZLR 331 at [67]-[82].   the law of champerty might apply) and a Waitangi Tribunal claim (where the plaintiffs 
say that law does not apply).  Illegality of champertous agreements is informed by 
public policy concerns, not taxonomy.  Further, public policy considerations behind 
the doctrine of maintenance do not remain static over time. 
[143] Mr Crossland acknowledged that promotion of access to justice is widely 
touted  to  support  conditional  fees  or  third-party  funding  agreements.    However, 
considerations such as access to justice must be balanced against an unconscionable 
exploitation of vulnerable litigants.  He submitted that it is this feature that renders the 
Agreements illegal.  He referred to the expressed wish of New Zealand Courts to be 
appraised of litigation funding arrangements, in the context of cases where groups of 
litigants are to be involved, before the litigation starts.  Doing that guards against 
unduly exploitative arrangements.32  In this case, what the plaintiffs seek in return for 
the $1.3 million they have paid is remarkable, exploitative, and would continue ad 
infinitum. 
[144] Finally, Mr Crossland submitted that if I was inclined to make the discovery 
orders sought by the plaintiffs, execution of the orders should be stayed pending the 
hearing and determination of the Settlement Trust Trustees' strike-out application. 
Plaintiffs' submissions in reply 
[145] Mr Salmon submitted that the issue of customary authority is a matter for 
argument at a later date — it is not an issue which should affect the plaintiffs' right to 
the discovery they seek.  That said, he submitted that the mandate procedures adopted 
in the Treaty claim negotiations with the Crown cannot inform the customary authority 
issue:  it was a process required by the Crown, not the Iwi.  Mr Taua was a rangatira 
and the chief negotiator for the Iwi in its Treaty claim.  He was the chair of the Tribal 
Authority.  There is a sufficient factual foundation for the discovery that is sought. 
[146] There has been no alienation of land in this case. 
                                                 32  Gulf  Cooperation  Ltd  (In  Receivership)  v  CFL  (NZ)  Ltd HC Auckland CIV-2010-404-5466, 
3 November 2011, at [29]-[46], and [78]-[85].   [147] Any concern under the Privacy Act cannot trump the plaintiffs' entitlement to 
discovery orders which are necessary for them to identify parties against whom they 
are entitled to legal redress. 
[148] Finally, Mr Salmon opposed the suggestion that any discovery order be stayed 
pending the hearing and determination of the strike-out claim. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
[149] First, there is no issue over the existence of the document or documents the 
plaintiffs will need to identify the fourth and fifth defendants they wish to join.  The 
register of Iwi members which the plaintiffs seek is acknowledged by the Trustees to 
be in the control of the Tribal Authority Trustees.  Also, the trust deed of the Settlement 
Trust provides at cl 5.1 that the Settlement Trust Trustees are to take such steps and 
institute such policies as are necessary to ensure that the register of Iwi members is 
maintained in a condition that is as up to date, accurate and complete as possible.  In 
those circumstances it seems more likely than not that a copy of the register of Iwi 
members is also within the power of the Settlement Trust Trustees. 
[150] On the issue of jurisdiction to make a Norwich Pharmacal order, I do not 
consider the "mere witness" rule can apply in the Trustees' favour in this case.  As 
Lord Cross noted in Norwich Pharmacal, someone involved in the transaction in 
question is not a mere witness.33  Lord Cross further noted that "In this field it was 
settled that if a party was properly made a defendant to a bill of relief the petitioner 
was entitled to discovery from him of the existence or whereabouts of other persons 
not parties in order that they might be made parties.34 
[151] In this case, the Tribal Authority Trustees, chaired by Mr Taua, are alleged to 
have been a party to the Variation Agreement along with the Contracting Iwi Members, 
and the Settlement Trust Trustees are alleged to have failed or refused to pay to Ms Lee 
the four per cent of the settlement assets that she says were assigned to her by Mr Taua.  
                                                 33  Norwich Pharmacal, above n 7, at 188. 34  At 192.   So it is at least alleged that the Trustees were involved in events or transactions 
relevant to the relief to be claimed against the proposed fourth and fifth defendants. 
[152] I think the principal question in this case will be whether the justice of the case 
requires the making of the order sought.35  That will require some consideration of the 
strength of the plaintiffs' case,36 although I note that in some cases it will be enough 
that the applicant has an "honest belief" that the unknown party has been guilty of the 
alleged wrongdoing,37 or a belief that he or she has a "bona fide claim" against the 
person whose identity is sought to be ascertained, and there is no other appropriate 
remedy.38 
[153] On the exercise of the Court's discretion, Mr Crossland's principal submission 
was that the plaintiffs have not produced a sufficient factual and/or legal foundation 
to  justify  the  making  of the  order sought.   They  have  not shown  that  Mr Taua, 
Ms Taylor and Mrs Ewe had authority to bind the members of the Iwi when they 
entered into the Agreements.  I think Mr Crossland was correct in identifying the 
authority point as central on the issue of the strength of the plaintiffs' case.  Have the 
plaintiffs put forward sufficient on the question of Mr Taua's authority to show that 
their claims are bona fide and more than merely speculative, such that the need to 
identify and join the proposed fourth and fifth defendants justifies application? 
[154] Mr Crossland made certain other submissions, and it will be convenient to 
address them first, before I deal with the question of whether the plaintiffs are or may 
be entitled to make the claims they wish to make against the proposed fourth and fifth 
defendants. 
[155] First, I do not think the Trustees' arguments based on alleged maintenance or 
champerty provide a sufficient basis to refuse the orders sought.  The plaintiffs are not 
required to show that their claims against the proposed fourth and fifth defendants will 
                                                 35  One  of  the  considerations  identified  by  Neuberger J  in The Coca  Cola  Company  v  British 
Telecommunications Plc, above n 13, referred to at [101](iii) of the judgment. 36  The Rugby Football Union v Consolidated Information Systems Ltd, above n 15, at [17]. 37  The Coca Cola Company v British Telecommunications Plc, above n 13, at 523. 38  Orr v Diaper (1876) 4 Ch.D 92 at 157 per Bale CJ and Finnemore J.   succeed, but merely to put up a sufficient basis of fact to show that the claims are bona 
fide, and are not purely speculative. 
[156] Mr Salmon  draws  a  distinction  between  maintaining  litigation  in  a  Court 
proceeding, and providing funding to an iwi to assist it to pursue a claim under the 
Treaty of Waitangi (in exchange for which the funder will take a proportion of the 
fruits of a successful Treaty claim).  Also, Mr Salmon points to s 76 of the Contract 
and Commercial Law Act 2017, under which the Court has jurisdiction to grant relief 
if a contract has been found to be illegal.  I accept that the maintenance/champerty 
defence goes to the issue of whether the plaintiffs' claims are likely to succeed rather 
than to the question of whether the plaintiffs have shown that they have a bona fide 
belief in their claims, and that their claims go beyond the purely speculative.  The 
defence is not suitable for determination on this application, and in my view it cannot 
provide a bar to the making of the order sought. 
[157] Mr Crossland next submitted that the register of members of the Iwi constitutes 
"information" about individual members of the Iwi, which is governed by the Privacy 
Act 1993.  He submitted that both the Tribal Authority and the Settlement Trust are 
"agencies" as defined in that Act.  Mr Salmon did not take issue with either of those 
propositions.  Mr Crossland then submitted that individuals registering as members of 
the Iwi did so for specific purposes set out in the Tribal Authority's membership 
registration form (for example, participation in Iwi elections, involvement in shaping 
the direction of the Iwi, accessing beneficiary entitlements, and building the Iwi 
whakapapa database).  The membership form contains a prominent heading "Privacy 
of Information", under which the Tribal Authority states that the information supplied 
will be kept confidential within the terms of the Privacy Act and will be for the lawful 
use of the Tribal Authority. 
[158] The Privacy Act sets out at s 6 a number of "privacy principles", and it contains 
provisions providing for an individual who considers that an agency has breached one 
of the privacy principles to make a complaint to the Privacy Commissioner. 
[159] Principle 10 provides that an agency that holds personal information that was 
obtained in connection with one person shall not use the information for any other   purpose  unless  the  agency  can  point  to  one  or  more  of  the  grounds  set  out  in 
subparagraphs (a)  to  (g)  of  the  Principle.    One  of  those grounds is  where 
non-compliance is necessary for the conduct of proceedings before any Court or 
Tribunal. 
[160] Principle 11 provides that an agency that holds personal information shall not 
disclose the information to a person or body or agency unless the agency reasonably 
believes that certain grounds for disclosure exist.  Again, one of the exceptions is "for 
the conduct of proceedings before any Court or Tribunal...". 
[161] The exceptions relating to the conduct of proceedings in any Court or Tribunal 
are given force by s 11(2) of the Privacy Act, which provides: 11 Enforceability of principles 
... 
(2) Subject to subsection (1), the information privacy principles do not 
confer on any person any legal right that is enforceable in a court of 
law. [162] Mr Salmon relied on s 11(2), submitting that the privacy principles cannot 
affect any right the plaintiffs may have to the pre-commencement discovery order they 
seek. 
[163] I accept Mr Salmon's submission on that point.  The individual members of the 
Iwi do not have any privacy rights that would be enforceable in this Court, and if I 
conclude that the justice of the case requires the making of the order the plaintiffs seek, 
the disclosure will in any event be necessary for the conduct of this proceeding. 
[164] In the alternative, Mr Crossland argued that, if the register is to be disclosed, 
the addresses of individual Iwi members should be redacted.  He submitted that a valid 
statement of claim could be filed by the plaintiffs without the inclusion of the addresses 
of  the  intended  fourth  and  fifth  defendants.    I  do  not  accept  that  submission.  
Rule 5.11(1)(g) of the High Court Rules 2016 requires the plaintiff to show in the 
statement of claim "the full name, and the place of residence and occupation, of every   plaintiff and defendant, so far as they are known to the party presenting the document 
for filing". 
[165] Mr Crossland also submitted that the names and addresses of any Iwi members 
who were minors as at the date of the 2007 Agreement should be redacted, on the basis 
that Tahi could not have entered into a valid contract with a minor.  Mr Salmon 
submitted that that is something to be dealt with downstream, and should not affect 
the ambit of any order for disclosure of the register which is now made.  I accept 
Mr Crossland's submission on this point as far as it goes, but there will be some Iwi 
members who were under the age of 18 on 27 June 2007, who could not thus be 
"Contracting Iwi Members", but who would nevertheless qualify as "Benefitting Iwi 
Members".  The issue in respect of those Iwi members would appear to be whether the 
plaintiffs  may  be  entitled  to  claim  against  the  proposed  fifth  defendants  (ie  the 
Benefitting Iwi Members).  I will address the question of the redaction of the names 
and addresses of minors from the register (whether they were minors as at 27 June 
2007 or now) later in this judgment, when I deal with the principal issue, namely 
whether the plaintiffs have shown that they have a bona fide non-speculative claim 
against the proposed fourth and fifth defendants. 
[166] Subject to that, I reject Mr Crossland's submissions based on the Privacy Act. 
[167] Mr Crossland suggested at the hearing that a determination of this application 
should await the hearing and determination of the Settlement Trust Trustees' strike-out 
application, in which the legality of the Agreements will be in issue.  But the strike-out 
application has not been brought by the Tribal Authority Trustees, so the claims against 
them will not be struck out.  And it is not clear that any success of the Settlement Trust 
Trustees on the strict illegality issue would necessarily have the effect of also bringing 
the claims against the Tribal Authority Trustees to an end.  There might, for example, 
be issues of relief under the Contract and Commercial Law Act 1977 to still be 
addressed.  Mr Salmon also submitted that the proposed fourth and fifth defendants, 
if joined, should have the opportunity to be heard on the strike-out application.  In all 
of those circumstances, and having regard to the fact that the discovery application has 
been fully argued, I am not prepared to adjourn this application for hearing with or 
after the strike-out application.   [168] Mr Crossland also submitted that the effect of the representation judgment is 
that the plaintiffs are estopped from pursuing their fourth cause of action against the 
Benefitting Iwi Members.  I note first that if and to the extent that access to the register 
of Iwi members should be given to the plaintiffs in order to permit them to formulate 
their claims (including identifying defendants) on the first cause of action, it will be 
academic whether or not the plaintiffs' other causes of action are good, at least insofar 
as the Contracting Iwi Members are concerned. 
[169] I  now  consider  the  bona  fides  and  apparent  strength  or  otherwise  of  the 
plaintiffs' claims.  In the first cause of action, Tahi contends that those who signed the 
Agreements did so as agent or trustee for the proposed fourth and fifth defendants 
(among others).  Ms Lee provided an affidavit saying that Mr Taua told her that he had 
authority to sign the Agreements on behalf of all Iwi members. 
[170] Mr Crossland submitted that Mr Taua could never have had that authority, and 
that Tahi and Ms Lee should have been aware of that fact. 
[171] Mr Taua's pleading on the authority issue may best be described as opaque.  In 
his statement of defence filed in June 2017, he admitted that he signed the Agreements, 
but denied that the Agreements are binding.  He pleaded affirmatively that he "had the 
authority to represent Iwi members", but denied the plaintiffs' allegation that he and 
Ms Taylor executed the 2007 Agreement as agents of the Iwi members and/or as 
trustees for the Iwi.  He also pleaded that the 2007 Agreement is void for uncertainty 
of terms. 
[172] In respect of the Variation Agreement, Mr Taua repeated the pleading that he 
"had the authority to represent Iwi Members", and the denial that any party is bound 
by the document.  He denied that he and Mrs Ewe executed the Variation Agreement 
as agents of the Iwi members and/or as trustees for the Iwi.  In response to a pleading 
that he executed the Variation Agreement as the agent of the Tribal Authority, he 
pleaded that he had the authority to represent the Tribal Authority, but otherwise 
denied the allegation.   [173] Mr Salmon relied on Mr Taua's authority as rangatira, and submitted that there 
is a sufficient factual foundation at this stage for the Court to find that he may establish 
at trial that he had implied authority, substantially derived from tikanga, to bind the 
Iwi members.  Mr Taua did after all have authority as lead negotiator with the Crown 
in the Treaty claim negotiations, and he was chairman of the Tribal Authority.  Beyond 
that, Mr Salmon submitted that the extent of Mr Taua's authority, and in particular, 
whether he had implied authority to bind individual Iwi members, is a matter for trial.  
The Court should not be concerned with it now. 
[174] The parties to the 2007 Agreement were Tahi and "Te Kawerau Ā Maki".  In 
the representation judgment, Lang J took the plaintiffs' claim to extend to individual 
members of the Iwi, even though they were not named as parties to the proceeding.  
His Honour assumed that the claim was against only those Iwi members who were 
over the age of 18 as at the date of the 2007 Agreement.39  Later in the representation 
judgment,  Lang J  declined  the  representation  order  sought  by  the  plaintiffs, 
substantially on the ground that "the plaintiffs can proceed against the members of the 
Iwi by adding them as respondents and arranging for them to be served...".  His 
Honour said that "[the plaintiffs] have no option now but to prove that each member 
of the Iwi authorised those who signed the Agreements on behalf of Te Kawerau Ā 
Maki to do so".40 
[175] Lang J noted in the representation judgment that the position might be different 
if the plaintiffs relied upon the status of the signatories to the Agreements as cloaking 
them, within the Iwi, with implied authority to bind individual members.  The learned 
Judge went on to say that, in that event, "it might be possible to establish an agency 
relationship regardless of the state of knowledge held by individual members of the 
Iwi.  A claim based on implied authority might therefore prevent individual members 
from defending the claim on the basis that they did not know of or consent to the 
signatories entering into the [Agreements] on their behalf."41 
                                                 39  Tahi Enterprises Ltd v Taua, above n 1, at [43]. 40  At [50]. 41  At [53].   [176] At  that  stage,  the  plaintiffs  were  not  pleading  agency  based  on  implied 
authority.  Now they are, and to that extent the position is different from that with 
which Lang J was concerned in the representation judgment. 
[177] In my view the plaintiffs have produced sufficient to show that Tahi's proposed 
claim on its first cause of action against the Contracting Iwi Members is bona fide, 
and has a sufficient substratum of fact to be more than purely speculative.  Tahi entered 
into written contracts with "Te Kawerau Ā Maki", and I agree with Lang J that it is 
reasonably arguable for Tahi that that meant those members of the Iwi who were of 
age, and thus legally able to enter into a contract.  If that is right, Mr Taua, Ms Taylor 
and Mrs Ewe signed the Agreements representing undisclosed principals (the adult 
individual Iwi members, whose identities were not disclosed).  The ordinary rule is 
that, where an agent enters into a contract for an undisclosed principal, the party 
contracting with the agent may sue the principal when the identity of the principal is 
discovered.42 
[178] The issue then, is whether Mr Taua had express or implied authority to bind 
the individual (adult) members of the Iwi.  On an interlocutory application such as this 
it is impossible to resolve that issue, but the starting point must be that, on the face of 
it, Mr Taua, Ms Taylor and Mrs Ewe presumably all considered when they signed one 
or both (in Mr Taua's case) of the Agreements that they had the necessary authority to 
enter into the Agreements on behalf of Iwi members.  And while denying that the 
Agreements were signed as agents for the Iwi members, Mrs Ewe's estate did join in 
the pleading in Mr Taua's statement of defence that Mr Taua "had the authority to 
represent Iwi Members". 
[179] I have already referred to the opaque nature of the first defendants' statement 
of defence on the issue of authority to enter into the Agreements, and I think the most 
the plaintiffs can probably take from the first defendants' statement of defence is that 
it is not just Mr Taua saying that he had some sort of authority to represent Iwi 
members — Mrs Ewe's estate has endorsed that view, and Ms Taylor presumably did 
                                                 42  Burrows, Finn & Todd, Law of Contract in New Zealand (5th ed, Lexis Nexis, Wellington, 2016) 
at 16.3.1(b).   too.  Beyond that, I do not think it is possible to take much from the first defendants' 
statement of defence. 
[180] I  acknowledge  Mr Crossland's  submission  that  Mr Taua's  own  statements 
cannot provide reliable evidence that he had authority to bind all adult Iwi members 
when he and his co-signatories signed the Agreements.  I accept too that there are real 
questions over the plaintiffs' claims based on implied authority/tikanga.  However, I 
do not consider those matters raise any issue of the bona fides of the plaintiffs' claims, 
or that they are sufficient to tip the claims into speculative, or "fishing", territory.  The 
facts are that Tahi entered into the Agreements which, on their face, appeared to be 
made on behalf of the Iwi members, and it then paid a total of $1.3 million under the 
Agreements.  It appears to have received no benefit in exchange for the payments it 
made.  So far then, nothing that could be called "speculative".  The question is the 
extent to which matters raised in defence, that may not be in the "king hit" category, 
should preclude the making of a discovery order.  McGechan J accepted in Welgas, 
one of the leading cases under r 8.20, that it would not be appropriate to make an order 
where the proposed claim was "plainly hopeless".  I accept that that must also be the 
position where the Court is asked to exercise its Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction.  But 
I do not think I can say that that is the position in this case, on the strength only of the 
affidavit evidence filed on this interlocutory application. 
[181] The Court of Appeal decision in Takamore v Clarke acknowledges that Māori 
customary law may be recognised as part of the common law in certain circumstances, 
and that applies to the customary law (tikanga) of a particular iwi.43  I have no direct 
evidence here of the relevant tikanga of Te Kawerau Ā Maki, other than some oblique 
references to the authority of rangatira in the "Historical Account" included within the 
Deed of Settlement between the Iwi and the Crown.  That Historical Account appears 
to acknowledge that rangatira have on occasion alienated Iwi land, although little is 
said about any processes that the tikanga of Te Kawerau Ā Maki may have required 
(hui, mandate etc) before that could occur. 
                                                 43  Takamore v Clarke [2012] 1 NZLR 573 at [170]-[174].   [182] Looking beyond Te Kawerau Ā Maki, some recent decisions appear to have 
endorsed the customary authority of an acknowledged kaumatua or rangatira to take 
at least certain steps on behalf of the iwi — see for example Proprietors of Wakatu v 
Attorney-General, where a rangatira was held entitled to bring a representative claim 
without the need for a representation order.  As the Chief Justice observed:  "Chiefs of 
high standing have long advanced such collective claims".44 
[183] In this case, I do not have before me details of any communications there may 
have been between Mr Taua and Iwi members before the Agreements were signed.  If 
there were no such communications, or if the communications were only to a limited 
number of Iwi members, then the Tribal Authority Trustees would presumably have 
been aware of that fact, and it would have been a relatively simple matter for them to 
have provided an affidavit stating that that was the position.  They did not do so.  Nor 
did they provide an affidavit explaining what they knew of the payments made by 
Tahi, and, to the extent they were aware of them, what they thought Tahi expected to 
receive in return for its payments. 
[184] I accept that it was for the plaintiffs to show that they have a bona fide claim 
which  is  more  than  merely  speculative,  but  Tahi  and  Ms Lee  having  produced 
contracts (the Agreements) which on  their  face  were  entered  into  by  Mr Taua, 
Ms Taylor and Mrs Ewe on behalf of the Contracting Iwi Members, the claimed lack 
of authority was either an affirmative defence or it was at least an issue on which the 
knowledge of what occurred would largely have been held (at least at the time of the 
Variation Agreement) by the Tribal Authority Trustees rather than the plaintiffs. 
[185] Similarly, I have no evidence of Te Kawerau Ā Maki tikanga that would be 
enough to show that the claims have not been brought bona fide, or have no real 
prospect of success. 
[186] Providing  the  discovery  sought  will  not  be  onerous  (only  the  register  of 
members is sought), and the matters raised in opposition (on the "lack of authority" 
                                                 44  Proprietors of  Wakatu  v Attorney-General [2017] 1 NZLR 423 at [494].  See for example:  
Te Heuheu Tukino v Aotea District Māori Land Board [1941] NZLR 590 (PC); Tamihana Korokai 
v The Solicitor-General (1912) 32 NZLR 321 (CA); and Wi Parata v Bishop of Wellington (1879) 
1 NZLRLC 14 (SC).   issue) are in my view insufficient for me to exercise my discretion against the making 
of the order sought, at least on the first cause of action.  I accordingly conclude that 
the register of members should be discovered on the basis of the proposed claims in 
the first cause of action, in respect of Iwi members who were 18 years of age or older 
as at 27 June 2007.  I will consider below whether Iwi members who were not 18 as 
at that date should have their names and addresses redacted from the register. 
[187] Two of the causes of action against the defendants45 are breach of contract 
causes of action.  I will consider them first, and in particular whether they appear to 
plead viable claims against those Iwi members who had not reached the age of 18 as 
at 27 June 2007. 
[188] Those Iwi members who were either not born or under 18 as at 27 June 2007 
(for convenience, I will call this group "the under 18s") could not have been parties to 
the Agreements — those who entered into the Agreements could not have done so as 
agents for either minors or non-existent principals.  The first cause of action in the 
Draft Claim could accordingly only affect the under 18s on the basis that those who 
entered into the Agreements did so as trustees for the under 18s.  But a party entering 
into a contract with a trustee does not normally have a right to sue the beneficiaries of 
the trust for breach of contract.  The first cause of action being for breach of contract, 
it does not appear that it could provide a good cause of action against the under 18s. 
[189] The fourth cause of action in the Draft Claim appears also to be a breach of 
contract cause of action, and I think similar considerations must apply.  Ms Lee entered 
into a contract on 28 November 2007 with Mr Taua, under which he agreed to sell her 
"his 4% interest in the Treaty claims settlement".  Any entitlement Mr Taua had to 
receive an interest in the Settlement Assets must have been conferred on him by 
agreement made for or on behalf of the Iwi members prior to that date, and Ms Lee's 
right  to  enforce  Mr Taua's  promise  to  pay  the  four  per  cent  was  presumably 
enforceable (if it was enforceable at all) only against those who had agreed with 
Mr Taua to confer that interest on him.  The under 18s could not have agreed to confer 
                                                 45  The first and fourth causes of action.   that interest on Mr Taua, as they were either too young to validly do so or they were 
not yet born. 
[190] Again, to the extent that the under 18s may be affected at all by any agreement 
to confer on Mr Taua an interest in the Settlement Assets, they would only be affected 
if and to the extent that those who made the agreement with Mr Taua did so acting in 
their capacities as trustee or trustees for the Iwi as a whole (including the under 18s).  
In such circumstances I think Ms Lee's action would be against the trustee(s), not 
against those such as the under 18s who were (or would become) mere beneficiaries 
of the trust that would ultimately receive the Settlement Assets. 
[191] In addition to those considerations, there should still be substantial assets held 
by the Settlement Trust Trustees, who are defendants on the fourth cause of action, 
with which to meet any entitlement Ms Lee might have to the four per cent interest 
she claims.46 
[192] For the foregoing reasons, I exercise my discretion against ordering discovery 
for the purpose of enabling joinder of the under 18s as defendants on either of the first 
or the fourth causes of action. 
[193] The second cause of action in the Draft Claim is pleaded in the alternative to 
the first cause of action.  It is a claim for unjust enrichment or equitable compensation, 
and it proceeds only if the Court should find the Agreements unenforceable.  The 
claims on this cause of action are claims against parties who are said to have received 
cash from Tahi, including as trustees for the Benefitting Iwi Members (and therefore 
the under 18s).  However, Mr Crossland made it clear in his submissions that the 
Benefitting Iwi  Members  have  not  received  the  Settlement Assets,  and I  do  not 
understand the claims to be claims in rem against the Settlement Assets (in which the 
under  18s do have  an  equitable  interest).    The  $1.3 million  paid  by Tahi  has 
presumably been spent, and the cause of action proceeds only on the basis that the 
arrangements under which Tahi paid its money (the Agreements) have failed, and 
                                                 46  Assuming any parties who made the agreement with Mr Taua acting in their capacities as trustees 
for (inter alia) the under 18s, were acting within their authority under the relevant trust or trusts 
and were entitled to indemnity from the Settlement Trust assets.   cannot be enforced.  Again, the proper claim appears to be against those who allegedly 
entered into the Agreements in their capacities as trustees for (inter alia) the under 18s, 
and not direct against the under 18s.47 
[194] I note also (as a factor going to the exercise of my discretion) that this is a 
cause of action where there appears to be no need for Tahi to join the under 18s.  The 
Settlement Trust Trustees have been joined as a party on this cause of action, and they 
were the recipients of the Settlement Assets.  It appears that there remain sufficient 
Settlement Assets in the hands of the Settlement Trust Trustees to meet any valid claim 
Tahi might have on its second cause of action, and that there would be little point in 
granting the discovery necessary to allow the under 18s to be added as defendants (it 
is difficult to imagine circumstances where the under 18s could have a direct liability 
to Tahi on this cause of action which was not also a liability of the Settlement Trust 
Trustees). 
[195] For those reasons, I decline to order discovery of the register, insofar as it 
discloses the identities of the under 18s, on the basis of the second cause of action in 
the Draft Claim. 
[196] The third cause of action in the Draft Claim proceeds on the basis that the 
Benefitting Iwi Members (including the under 18s) are necessary parties to Tahi's 
claim to be subrogated to the rights of those with whom it contracted in their capacities 
as trustees, to be indemnified out of trust assets (and to enforce a trustee's lien over 
trust assets). 
[197] There will be an obvious first question as to whether those who may have 
entered into the Agreements as trustee will be entitled to indemnity out of the assets 
of the relevant trust or trusts, in respect of any liability they may be found to have to 
Tahi under the Agreements.  However, I do not think it necessary to answer that 
question on this application. 
                                                 47  The principle that a trustee is liable for all liabilities the trust incurs in carrying out the trust is well 
established (see Andrew Butler, Equity & Trusts in New Zealand, (Thomson Reuters, Wellington, 
2009) at 16.6.1).  This is subject to two exceptions:  (a) where the trustee is the agent of the 
beneficiaries and (b) where a lender has agreed to limit the trustee's liability.  Neither of those 
exceptions are applicable in this case.   [198] As  the  learned  authors  of Lewin  on  Trusts note,  the  right  of subrogation 
prevents the beneficiaries from avoiding liabilities which properly fall on the trust fund 
by having a trustee who is a man of straw.48  But in this case there is no evidence that 
the Settlement Trust Trustees are insolvent, and nothing to suggest they would not 
exercise any right they might have to claim indemnity from relevant trust assets.  And 
it is apparent from Mr Crossland's submissions that the under 18s themselves do not 
have possession of, or control over, the Settlement Assets. 
[199] The learned authors of Lewin on Trusts say:49 Plainly, the person in whom the relevant property is vested will need to be 
joined as a party.  In an ordinary case, a trustee, though personally liable, is 
entitled to meet a liability to a creditor directly from the trust property, and 
there appears to be no practical problem such as justifies the creditor or other 
claimant in bringing proceedings against the beneficiaries so as to enforce the 
claim against the trust property.  It may therefore be the case that the court will 
make an order in favour of a creditor or other claimant who claims to be 
subrogated to the trustee's right of indemnity only where the trust is being 
administered by the court, or where there is good reason for the creditor or 
other claimant to bring proceedings against the beneficiaries, as where the 
creditor or other claimant is unable to enforce the personal liability of the 
trustee, or the trustee's right of indemnity is disputed by the beneficiaries and 
it  is  consequently  reasonable  to  allow  the  creditor  or  other  claimant  to 
establish the right of indemnity so as to enable his claim to be met from the 
trust fund should he succeed in establishing the right of indemnity.  (Citations 
omitted.) [200] It appears that no part of the "relevant property" is vested in the under 18s, so 
their joinder as parties could not be required on that account.  Nor is it arguably 
necessary to join the under 18s on the basis that the Settlement Trust Trustees are 
unavailable to meet any personal liability they may be found to have (there is no 
evidence of that).  The real issue, it seems to me, is the possibility (likelihood even) 
that the rights of those who may be found to have entered into the Agreements as 
trustees for (inter alia) the under 18s to indemnity out of the Settlement Assets, will be 
challenged by some Iwi members, on the basis that they had no authority to enter into 
the Agreements. 
                                                 48  Lynton Tucker et al Lewin on Trusts (Thomson Reuters, 19th Ed) at 21-052. 49  At 21-053.   [201] But the conduct of any such challenge would presumably be carried by those 
Iwi members who were adult members of the Iwi at the times the Agreements were 
made and who are alleged to have (expressly or impliedly) conferred the required 
authorities on Ms Taylor, Mr Taua and Mrs Ewe — the Contracting Iwi Members.  I 
have already held that the register of members is to be disclosed for the purposes of 
provided the names and addresses of the Contracting Iwi Members, so there would 
appear to be no need for additional disclosure of the names and addresses of the under 
18s to ensure that any trustees' claims to indemnity out of the Settlement Assets can 
be properly tested. 
[202] I note also that Lang J considered in the representation judgment that the issue 
of subrogation would necessarily be considered in the context of any relief that the 
Court might grant after the Court has made its primary findings on issues of liability.50  
Whether or not that will be the position I need not say — it is enough for present 
purposes to say that if the learned Judge was correct that would provide another ground 
pointing against the need for, or desirability of, ordering discovery at this stage of the 
names and addresses of the under 18s. 
[203] I observe too that it seems likely that at some point the Court will need to return 
to the question of the need for representation orders.  If, having ascertained their 
identities, the plaintiffs apply to join the 400 or so Contracting Iwi Members as fourth 
defendants,  consideration  will  presumably  have  to  be  given  to  the  making  of 
representation orders at that point, to ensure that the proceeding is efficiently managed.  
That will be a matter for counsel to consider in due course, but for now it seems likely 
that there could be at least two differing interest groups among the Contracting Iwi 
Members, namely those who accept that Mr Taua, Ms Taylor and Mrs Ewe had the 
authority to enter into the Agreements on behalf of all Iwi members, and those who do 
not.   There  may  be  other  groups  with  different  interests  that  would  have  to  be 
represented, but that is a question for another day.  Its present relevance is only that it 
suggests the possibility that the Court might consider it appropriate in the future to 
appoint counsel (or some other representative) to represent the under 18s in the 
proceeding, at least if it appeared that their interests might differ from those of any 
                                                 50  Tahi Enterprises Ltd v Taua, above n 1, at [46].   Contracting Iwi Members taking the position that the Agreements are not binding or 
that the plaintiffs are not entitled to the relief they seek for any other reason. 
[204] I take into account also the fact that a number of the considerations identified 
as relevant to the exercise of the Norwich  Pharmacal jurisdiction in The  Rugby 
Football Union 51 point against the making of an order for disclosure of the identities 
of the under 18s.  First, they are clearly not "wrongdoers" in any sense of the word, 
and there is no question of the making of an order for the disclosure of their identities 
somehow deterring wrongdoing.  The making of such an order clearly would result in 
the revealing of the names of innocent persons, and in such circumstances the need for 
disclosure must be greater (if it is to trump the right of a wholly innocent person to his 
or her right to privacy).  In this case, I do not think the need for disclosure is that great, 
particularly where the identities of the Contracting Iwi Members will be disclosed and 
the public interest in the plaintiffs being allowed to vindicate any legal rights they may 
have can be satisfied by that joinder (considered with the fact that the Settlement Trust 
Trustees apparently still hold the Settlement Assets, and the Court's ability in due 
course to appoint a representative for the under 18s if that proves to be necessary and 
appropriate). 
[205] All of those considerations lead me to conclude that the plaintiffs have not 
made out a sufficient case for Norwich Pharmacal discovery of the register of Iwi 
members insofar as it discloses the names or addresses of the under 18s.  In the 
exercise of my discretion, I decline to order that disclosure. 
[206] It  is  not  necessary  for  me  to  refer  to  Mr Crossland's  other  arguments  in 
opposition to the orders sought insofar as they affect the under 18s. 
Application to stay any order pending the hearing and determination of the 
Settlement Trust Trustees' strike-out application 
[207] Mr Crossland asked that, in the event of an order for discovery being made, the 
Court  should  stay  execution  of  the  order  pending  the  hearing  of  the  strike-out 
application.  I am not prepared to do that, substantially for the same reasons I was not 
                                                 51  The Rugby Football Union v Consolidated Information Systems Ltd, above n 15.   prepared to defer giving judgment on the discovery application.52  The parties have 
fully argued the discovery issues, and the disclosure ordered will not be onerous. 
Result 
[208] I make the following orders: 
(1) Within 30 working days of the delivery of this judgment the Tribal 
Authority Trustees are to make available for inspection by the plaintiffs 
the register of members of the Te Kawerau Ā Maki Iwi referred to at 
paragraph 3 of the Trustees' notice of opposition dated 3 May 2018, 
together  with  any  other  registers  of  the  Iwi  members  the  Tribal 
Authority Trustees may have in their control.  The register or registers 
is to be made available for inspection as aforesaid with the names of all 
Iwi members who were either unborn or under the age of 18 as at 
27 June 2007 redacted. 
(2) Within 30 working days of the delivery of this judgment, the Settlement 
Trust Trustees are to file and serve an affidavit stating whether they 
have or have had in their control a register or registers of members of 
Te Kawerau Ā Maki. 
(3) Within 30 working days of the delivery of this judgment, the Settlement 
Trust Trustees are also to make available for inspection by the plaintiffs 
any register or registers of Iwi members discovered by them pursuant 
to order (2) above.  Again, the register or registers of members is/are to 
be made available for inspection as aforesaid with the names of all Iwi 
members who were either unborn or under the age of 18 as at 27 June 
2007 redacted. 
(4) If such a register or registers has/have been but is/are no longer in the 
control  of  the  Settlement Trust Trustees,  they  are  to  state  in  their 
affidavit their best knowledge and belief as to when such register or 
                                                 52  Paragraph [167] of this judgment.   registers ceased to be in their control, and who now has control of 
it/them. 
(5) Costs — I do not think this is a case for either increased costs or no 
costs.  Mr Crossland submitted that there should be no order for costs, 
on the basis that the Trustees have acted responsibly in opposing the 
application in order to protect the privacy of Iwi members.  But I think 
the Trustees did more than that.  They mounted strenuous opposing 
arguments which, if successful, would have precluded the plaintiffs 
from taking the course contemplated by Lang J in the representation 
judgment, namely suing the individual Contracting Iwi Members.  In 
those circumstances, the plaintiffs would normally be entitled to an 
award of costs, and I see no reason to differ from that broad approach 
in this case.  However, I see no basis for an award above scale costs, 
and  the  Trustees  have  been  partially  successful  (in  opposing  the 
application insofar is it related to the under 18s, and in submitting that 
r 8.20 could not apply).  In the end, I think the justice of the case will 
be met if the plaintiffs are awarded costs on a 2B basis, reduced by 
25 per cent to reflect the factors just mentioned, plus disbursements as 
fixed by the Registrar.  I make orders accordingly.
