Solicitors:
Richard Mark (Kerikeri) for Appellant
Marsden Woods Inskip Smith (Whangarei) for Respondent   Introduction
[1] Ms Green appeals a decision of Judge Harrison in the District Court ordering
her to pay Mr Carr $12,500 under an agreement to which they are both party.1
Background
[2] Ms Green is a registered proprietor of land which adjoins land owned by
Mr Carr.  Ms Green's land had no viable access to the nearest road (Motukiore Road).
Proceedings were initiated in the High Court to gain access to Motukiore Road, across
Mr Carr's  land.    Mr Carr  counterclaimed.   A  judicial  settlement  conference was
convened  and on  23 March  2009,  after  lengthy  negotiation,  a  written  settlement
agreement was entered into by the parties.  The agreement provided, relevantly:
(a) For the granting of a right-of-way easement by Mr Carr following a
route shown on a schematic plan attached to the settlement agreement.
(b) Mr Carr would construct a roadway (earthworks only) along the right-
of-way.  Its width was to be 4.5 metres, excluding shoulders, and the
gradient would not exceed 1 in 5.
(c) The  registered  proprietors  of  Ms Green's land  would  pay  Mr Carr
$25,000 according to a stipulated timetable.  This payment was to settle
Mr Carr's counterclaim.  It related to fencing issues and had nothing to
do with the easement.
(d) Ms Green and the other registered proprietors of her land were to pay
Mr Carr, promptly, $5,000 upon completion of the roadway.
[3] Mr Carr (through a contractor) constructed the roadway on 24 and 25 April
2009.  On 1 May 2009, Ms Green and the other registered proprietors caused their
solicitors to pay the $5,000 to Mr Carr.  The only reservation attached to the paying of
the $5,000 was a concern about the stability of the earthworks.
                                                 1  Carr v Green [2018] NZDC 12906.   [4] At this point, I introduce Mr Green.  He is Ms Green's father.  He is not a party
to the dispute and he is not a registered proprietor of Ms Green's land.  However, he
is the patriarch and his views and decisions are accepted as binding Ms Green as her
agent.  It seems clear that Mr Green and Mr Carr do not have an easy relationship.
Points  of  dispute  between  Mr Green  and  Mr Carr  arose  after the  roadway  was
constructed.  These are set out in a letter dated 20 August 2009 from Webb Ross, the
solicitors representing (nominally) Ms Green.  The letter does not mention the dispute
which is now before the Court.
[5] It is common ground that Mr Carr in constructing the roadway deviated from
the route shown on the schematic plan attached to the settlement agreement.  The
evidence is that the deviation was on the advice of the roading contractor Mr Carr
employed to carry out the work.  Apparently, the planned route made it difficult to
intersect the roadway with Motukiore Road without risking undermining the road.
Significant retaining and battering works would have been required.  Mr Carr took the
advice of the roading contractor and agreed to have a roadway constructed so it met
Motukiore Road at a distance downhill from the planned route where the identified
problems would not arise.  This involved removing and relocating a telegraph pole,
the expense of which was met by Mr Carr.
[6] Initially, Mr Green took no exception to the deviation from the planned route.
But later he did.  As a result, Ms Green took no steps to perform obligations under the
agreement pertaining to her and the other registered proprietors.  In particular, the
roadway was not covered with roading metal and no fences along its length were
constructed.
[7] Mr Vryer, a registered proprietor of Ms Green's land as to a one-half share,
accepted the situation.  He paid his half of the $25,000 which the settlement agreement
provided should be paid to Mr Carr.  Mr Green refused to allow Ms Green to pay the
outstanding $12,500.  Eventually, Mr Carr sued Ms Green for the $12,500.  He was
successful in the District Court.  Judge Harrison found he was entitled to be paid.
Mr Green does not accept Judge Harrison's decision.  He has caused Ms Green to
appeal.  His arguments turn on his construction of the evidence heard by Judge   Harrison  and  he  criticises  the  Judge's  evidential  findings.    He  also  raises  legal
objections going to the proper construction of the settlement agreement.
[8] Put shortly, Mr Green contends that Mr Carr breached the contract by deviating
from the planned route, that nothing in Mr Green's subsequent conduct (as the agent
of Ms Green) varied the agreement to permit the deviation and nor did his subsequent
conduct affirm contractually the deviation.  Accordingly, Mr Green's position is that
Ms Green need not perform any of her obligations under the settlement agreement
until Mr Carr has performed his, which includes forming the roadway over the planned
route.
The pleadings
[9] Mr Carr pleaded reliance on the settlement agreement: 5. The plaintiff relies on the settlement agreement ("the Agreement") as
if pleaded in full, but specifically refers to the following clauses: 11. The  plaintiffs  agree to  pay  to  the  first  defendant  the  sum  of
$25,000.00 in full settlement of the first defendant's counter-claim.
Payment shall be on the sale of the plaintiff's land (including that of the
second defendant) or the sale of any part of that land or at a date that is
three years from 23 March 2009, namely 23 March 2012, whichever is
the earlier.
13. In this agreement the plaintiff's land means the land in Lot 1
Deposited Plan 137752 Mangamuka Survey District.
14. In  the  event  of  the  plaintiffs  failing  to  pay  any sum  payable  in
terms  of  this  agreement  to  the  first  defendant,  the  unpaid  sum  shall
attract interest from the date of 23 March 2009 (calculated with monthly
rests)  at  the  interest  rate  of  10.0%  upon  that  sum  being  due,  together
with all costs of recovering the sum outstanding. [10] Mr Carr relied on a simple breach of contract: the $25,000 became due and
owing on 23 March 2012 and Ms Green failed to pay any part of it.
[11] Ms Green in her statement of defence pleaded (relevantly):2
(a) Mr Carr breached the settlement agreement by failing to construct the
roadway to the agreed specifications.
                                                 2  A number of the pleadings, for example that Mr Green was not Ms Green's agent, had fallen by
the wayside by the time of trial.    (b) Construction of the roadway was a "condition precedent" to Ms Green
having to pay the $12,5000, and since Mr Carr has not constructed the
roadway as agreed the payment obligation has not arisen.
(c) The  roadway  constructed  by  Mr Carr,  being  outside  the  agreed
specifications, means Ms Green will incur greater costs in providing
access to it across her own land.  Ms Green is entitled to set-off such
increased costs against the $12,500 should she be found liable to pay
that sum.
Approach on appeal
[12] The  appeal  is  by  way  of  rehearing.    That  means  I  must  make  my  own
assessment of the evidence and reach my own opinion on the issues.  If there are issues
of credibility, or weight, I will bear in mind that Judge Harrison had the benefit of
assessing the witnesses as they gave their evidence.
Issues
[13] I find the issues on appeal to be:
(a) Did  Mr Carr  construct  the  roadway  in  compliance  with  the
specifications in the settlement agreement?
(b) Did the changed route of the roadway breach Mr Carr's obligations
under the settlement agreement?
(c) If so, did Mr Green's and Ms Green's actions after the construction of
the roadway amount to a variation of the agreement, or otherwise an
acceptance of what was done?
The construction of the roadway
[14] The first three clauses of the settlement agreement are: 1. The first defendant shall construct a road formation (earthworks only)
connecting Motukiore Road to the boundary of the easement area as   part shown under Option 2 in plans presented by expert engineers at the
judicial  settlement  conference  ("the  settlement  conference")  on
23 March 2009.
2. The specification for the work undertaken by the first defendant shall
be:
▪ 4.5m wide carriageway in earthworks (exclusive of shoulders)
▪ maximum grade of 1 in 5
▪ ends  5  metres  before  the  easement  boundary  (easement  to
extend to meet existing easement)
3. The  costs  of  all  applications  and  approvals  required  for  the
construction of roading in Clause 1 shall be the responsibility of and
be paid promptly by the plaintiffs. [15] The witnesses in the trial were:
• For Mr Carr:
(a) Mr Harding – a civil and geotechnical engineer.
(b) Mr Ross – a surveyor.
(c) Mr Rintoul – Managing Director of the company which constructed the
roadway.
(d) Mr Carr.
(e) Mr Vryer – the registered proprietor of a half interest in Ms Green's
land (not required for cross-examination).
(f) Mr Ambler – a civil engineer (deceased, but his affidavit in evidence).
• For Ms Green
(a) Mr Green.
(b) Mr Scanlen – a traffic roading engineer.
[16] On the issue of compliance with the specifications:   (a) Mr Harding's  opinion  (including  his  review  of  work  done  by  the
deceased engineer, Mr Ambler) was the roadway was well-constructed,
it should meet the Far North District Council's requirements for an
intersection with Motukiore Road, and it should not cause Ms Green
additional  cost  to  join  it  from  her  land.    He  conceded  in  cross-
examination that the angle at which the roadway meets Motukiore Road
(about 20°) means a truck and trailer would not be able to turn left onto
the road in one movement.  However, that is not very different to the
situation provided for in the plan attached to the settlement agreement.
The  roadway  intersection  could  be  modified  to  conform  with  the
attached plan "very easily".
(b) Mr Ross was the surveyor who drew the plan attached to the settlement
agreement.  His view was that the deviated route was desirable and
necessary to allow for the fact that when he drew the plan the roadway
was to be 3m in width whereas the settlement agreement called for a
4.5m width.  His opinion was that Ms Green should not incur extra cost
in connecting to the as-built roadway.
(c) Mr Rintoul  gave  evidence  the  intersection  of  the  roadway  with
Motukiore Road would be approved by the Far North District Council.
He confirmed it was on his advice that the route was changed and that
the reason was to avoid the risk the indicated route would have incurred
of undermining Motukiore Road.
(d) Mr Scanlen disagreed with the above witnesses.  His opinion was that
the deviated route meant there would be considerable extra cost to
Ms Green  in  finishing  the  roadway  on  her  side  of  the  easement
boundary.  He took some issue with the gradient.
(e) Mr Carr  and  Mr Green  had  opposing  views  on  the  effect  of  the
deviation on the costs to Ms Green of constructing her portion of the
roadway.  They had opposing views of the quality of the construction
of the roadway and whether it conformed to the specifications.  They   had opposing views on whether Mr Green inspected and approved the
roadway.
[17] Judge Harrison found, essentially, that the evidence established, to the civil
standard  of  proof,  that  the  roadway  was  constructed  in  compliance  with  the
specifications in the settlement agreement.  Having considered the evidence, that is
also my view.  In particular, relying on the evidence of the experts, the width of the
carriageway (exclusive of the  shoulders) and its grade, were within the clause 2
specifications.
The significance of the changed route
[18] Mr Carr was obliged to construct the roadway (earthworks only) "as part
shown under Option 2 in plans presented".  The plan, a schematic plan, showed a route
for the roadway under Option 2.  Mr Green argues that it was a contractual obligation
that the formed roadway follow the Option 2 route exactly.  He says that this was a
condition precedent to the payment of the $12,500.  Since the roadway was not
constructed in accordance with the Option 2 route, Mr Green argues he was under no
obligation to pay the $12,500.
[19] Put simply, I do not think Mr Green's view of the agreement can be sustained.
[20] The modern approach to contractual interpretation was laid out by the majority
of the Supreme Court in Firm PI 1 Ltd v Zurich Australian Insurance Ltd:3 [60] ... It is sufficient to say that the proper approach is an objective one,
the aim being to ascertain "the meaning which the document would convey to
a  reasonable  person  having  all  the  background  knowledge  which  would
reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they
were at the time of the contract". This objective meaning is taken to be that
which the parties intended. While there is no conceptual limit on what can be
regarded as "background", it has to be background that a reasonable person
would regard as relevant. Accordingly, the context provided by the contract as
a whole and any relevant background informs meaning.
[61] The requirement that the reasonable person have all the background
knowledge known or reasonably available to the parties is a reflection of the                                                  3  Firm PI 1 Ltd v Zurich Australian Insurance Ltd [2014] NZSC 147, [2015] 1 NZLR 432; endorsed
by the Court of Appeal in Ward Equipment Ltd v Preston [2017] NZCA 444, [2018] NZCCLR 15
at [57].   fact that contractual language, like all language, must be interpreted within its
overall context, broadly viewed. Contextual interpretation of contracts has a
significant history in New Zealand, although for many years it was restricted
to situations of ambiguity. More recently, however, it has been confirmed that
a purposive or contextual interpretation is not dependent on there being an
ambiguity in the contractual language.
...
[63] While context is a necessary element of the interpretive process and
the focus is on interpreting the document rather than particular words, the text
remains centrally important. If the language at issue, construed in the context
of the contract as a whole, has an ordinary and natural meaning, that will be a
powerful, albeit not conclusive, indicator of what the parties meant. But the
wide context may point to some interpretation other than the most obvious one
and may also assist in determining the meaning intended in cases of ambiguity
or uncertainty.
(Citations omitted) [21] I make two points.
[22] First, I do not think that Mr Carr was contractually obliged to construct the
roadway  in strict accordance  with Option  2.   The  context of the  making  of the
agreement is relevant.  Ms Green wanted access from her land to Motukiore Road.
The High Court was being asked to order such access.  The Option 2 route was agreed
to be a viable route.  It was shown in a schematic plan and the roadway was shown to
be 3m in width.  The agreement was for the width to be 4.5m.  The work was to be
done by Mr Carr and with a price of $5,000 which included consideration for the
granting of the easement.  It was not envisaged to be a significant task.
[23] I do not consider that, objectively constructed, Mr Carr was required to follow
the exact route of Option 2.  So long as the specification of the roadway was met, so
long as the price of $5,000 was all that was charged, and so long as the deviated route
did not significantly increase the cost to Ms Green of forming her part of the roadway
to connect with Mr Carr's work, then Mr Carr was able to deviate from the Option 2
route.
[24] I prefer the evidence of the experts called by Mr Carr on the effect of the
deviated route on Ms Green's costs.  They refuted Mr Scanlen's evidence that it would
mean significant further costs, particularly in retaining works.  Their evidence was that
the deviated route is materially better for Ms Green.   [25] The remaining issue is the change to the angle at which the roadway meets
Motukiore Road.  I accept the roadway angle of interception is more acute than the
Option 2 angle of interception.  This makes it more difficult for vehicles to exit the
roadway and turn left onto Motukiore Road.  However, from a contractual point of
view, I do not see that as a breach on the part of Mr Carr.  The Option 2 plan was never
an exact path and cl 2 made no specification as to the angle of interception with
Motukiore Road.  It was a schematic plan and the agreed specification was different.
[26] Second, even if I am wrong and Option 2 did impose contractual obligations
on Mr Carr, I do not think that these constituted a condition precedent such that
Mr Carr's failure to perform them meant that Mr Green was not obliged to pay him
the $12,500 under cl 11 of the agreement.
[27] That is apparent from an objective and contextual reading of the agreement.
Mr Green's obligation to pay for the fencing and Mr Carr's obligation to construct the
roadway were unrelated matters.  There is simply nothing in the agreement to suggest
that the performance of one obligation might be contingent on the other.4  If Mr Carr
had breached an obligation to construct the roadway in exact accordance with Option 2
(which he did not given this was not a contractual obligation under the agreement),
Mr Green would have been entitled to claim for damages or, if the statutory criteria
were satisfied, cancel the agreement under the Contractual Remedies Act 1979 (CRA),
which was operative at the time.  Mr Carr's alleged breach, even if established, would
not have relieved Mr Green of his obligation to pay the $12,500 under the agreement.
Variation or Affirmation?
[28] I do not need to consider these issues.  But, they were argued and so I will give
my conclusions on the assumption that I am wrong and Mr Carr's failure to construct
the roadway in accordance with Option 2 did relieve Mr Green of his obligation to pay
the $12,500.  On this basis, I now turn to consider whether Mr Green's conduct
subsequent to the breach may have changed his position.
                                                 4  See cls 1-3 at [14].   Variation
[29] Judge Harrison found that while the finishing touches were being made to the
roadway, Mr Green came down to inspect it and walked along it with Mr Carr.  He
approved it.  Mr Green denied doing any such thing.  I cannot say that finding by the
Judge was in error.  The Judge saw Mr Carr and Mr Green give their evidence.  He
had  regard  to  the  prompt  payment  of  the  $5,000.    Clause  16  of  the  settlement
agreement provided: For the purposes of clarification the sum of $5,000.00 referred to in Clause 4
shall be paid immediately upon completion of the work referred to in Clause
1 on the basis that such funds shall be held in the trust account of the first
defendant's solicitor until the legal easement over the relevant land has been
created. No interest shall be payable to the plaintiffs on such sum. [30] The Judge also had regard to the fact that the letter accompanying the payment
of the $5,000 contained a reservation only about the stability of the earthworks.  The
route of the roadway was not raised as an issue in the letter of 20 August 2009.5  It
was only later that complaint was made about the route.
[31] Finally, Judge Harrison had regard to an email Mr Carr sent his own lawyers
not long after the inspection by Mr Green in which he referred to it.
[32] Mr Carr argues that by this conduct Mr Green agreed to vary the agreement.
[33] Justice Wylie summarised the law on variation in MacDonald v C1 Gloucester
Street Ltd:6 [26] A contract once made can be varied by agreement between the parties.
However, a unilateral change by one party without any agreement by the other
party, cannot be a variation, except where the agreement provides for such a
power in that party.
...
[29] Since a variation involves an alteration as a matter of contract of the
contractual relationship between the parties, the agreement for variation must
itself possess the characteristics of a valid contract. The parties must be ad
idem and negotiations for a variation that do not result in agreement have no                                                  5  See [4]. 6  MacDonald v C1 Gloucester Street Ltd [2012] NZHC 2842.   effect. Further, any agreement for a variation must generally be supported by
consideration or made by deed.
[30] When a contract is varied, it operates according to the variation.  A
variation may be by express agreement or may be implied by conduct, but
where a contract is required by law to be evidenced in writing, it cannot be
varied by an oral agreement...
(Citations omitted) [34] The burden of proof in establishing an enforceable oral variation rests on the
party alleging the variation.7
[35] In this case, Mr Carr has not persuaded me that the alleged variation has the
characteristics of a valid contract.  That is for the simple reason that, according to his
version of events, Mr Green only voiced his approval of the alteration of the roadway
after it had been constructed.  It is trite law that an act done prior to a promise being
made cannot constitute consideration.8
[36] However, recently there has been debate about the extent to which there must
be fresh consideration for a variation.  Mr Carr refers me to the following comments
of Arnold J in Teat v Willcocks:9 [54] ...Although  the  position  is  not  yet  settled,  we  consider  that
consideration in the form of a benefit "in practice" is sufficient to support a
binding variation. Further, we are attracted to the alternative view expressed
by this Court in Antons Trawling Co Ltd v Smith that no consideration at all
may be required provided the variation is agreed voluntarily and without
illegitimate pressure. This seems to us to reflect the reality of what happened
in the present case – a variation was proposed and willingly accepted, and the
parties  proceeded  on  that  basis.  In  the  context  of  an  existing  agreement
supported by consideration, that seems to us to be sufficient to constitute a
binding variation.
(Citations omitted)                                                  7  Conqueror International Ltd v Mach's Gladiator Ltd [2018] NZHC 265 at [40]. 8  For a recent example, see D4 Cash Investors Ltd v Advance Creative Technologies Ltd [2017]
NZHC 3280 at [71] citing Eastwood v Kenyon (1840) 11 Ad & El 438. 9  Teat v Willcocks [2013] NZCA 162, [2014] 3 NZLR 129.   [37] This view has been picked up on in a number of High Court decisions.10  Justice
Venning summarised the position in New Zealand Local Authority Protection Disaster
Fund v Auckland Council:11 [35] Although the position is not yet finally settled in New Zealand, it may
not now be necessary for consideration in the traditional sense to be provided
in order for an agreed variation of an existing contract to be binding. It may
be sufficient for the parties to agree to the proposed variation "voluntarily and
without illegitimate pressure." Where the parties have proceeded upon the
basis of a variation that was proposed and willingly accepted, the Court may
hold that to be sufficient to constitute a binding variation. The most important
feature of this test for present purposes is that a variation must be proposed by
one party and willingly accepted by the other.
(Citations omitted) [38] I do not think it is necessary for me to contribute to what is still an unsettled
area of law.  In any case, even if I were to adopt the approach suggested by Arnold J,
it would not change my decision.  That is because no variation was proposed.  The
construction occurred and then Mr Green approved it.  I do not think that assent after
the fact can constitute a binding variation without more.
[39] I therefore find that Mr Carr and Mr Green did not agree to vary the contract
to accommodate the actual route of the roadway.
Affirmation
[40] Judge Harrison held that Mr Carr affirmed the agreement: [27] The Greens use the right-of-way.  They did not cancel the contract
because to do so would have meant they would not be able to use it because
they would have had no right to cross Mr Carr's land.
[28] I am of the view that that Greens have affirmed the contract.  In Chitty
on Contracts Vol 1, 31st Edn, at para 24-003 the following is stated: Where the innocent party, being entitled to choose whether to treat
the contract as continuing or to accept the repudiation and treat
himself as discharged, elects to treat the contract as continuing, he
is usually said to have "affirmed" the contract.  He will not be held
to have elected to affirm the contract unless, first, he has knowledge
of the facts giving rise to the breach, and secondly, he has knowledge
of his legal right to choose between the alternatives open to him.                                                   10  See Mulholland v Hansen [2015] NZHC 895 at [25] and Baxter v Coleman [2016] NZHC 2693 at
[209]-[210]. 11  New Zealand Local Authority Protection Disaster Fund v Auckland Council [2013] NZHC 1858.   Affirmation may be express or implied.  It will be implied if, with
knowledge of the breach and of his right to choose, he does some
unequivocal act from which it may be inferred that he intends to go
on with the contract regardless of the breach or from which it may
be inferred that he will not exercise his right to treat the contract as
repudiated.  Affirmation must be total: the innocent party cannot
approbate and  reprobate  by  affirming  part  of  the  contract  and
disaffirming the rest, for that would be to make a new contract. [29] For the reasons given, Mr Green affirmed the changes to the agreed
driveway and has in any event affirmed the change by constructing his part of
the right-of-way to connect with that on Mr Carr's land.  Consequently, he has
no right of set-off for any work he may have done to make the driveway fully
operational,  although  I  record  Mr  Carr's  view  that  no  further  work  was
required.  Even if the alleged breach of the contract had not been affirmed, the
amount claimed by way of set-off has not been proved. [41] I agree with the thrust of Judge Harrison's comments, but I do not think the
issue of affirmation is relevant.  That is because there was no purported cancellation
of the contract.  Under the CRA a party could cancel a contract if an essential term
was broken.12  However, they were unable to do so if they had affirmed the contract
with full knowledge of the breach.13
[42] In this case, there was no suggestion by Mr Green that Mr Carr had broken an
essential term or that Mr Green otherwise had the right to cancel the contract.  The
position of both parties was that the contract remained afoot.  The dispute was simply
over the correct interpretation of the contract.  No issue of affirmation therefore arose.
[43] I accept the Judge's point that Mr Green, by his conduct, accepted the altered
route of the roadway and the evidential findings on which he based this view.  By my
reading, the Judge's broad view was that Mr Green's subsequent conduct seriously
undermined any argument by Mr Green that Mr Carr should be held accountable for
his breach of contract.  The Judge concluded that Mr Green affirmed the contract and
therefore could not claim a right of set-off.  I do not think this is an accurate application
of the law of affirmation.  If Mr Green had affirmed the contract, that would have
prevented him from cancelling it, not from arguing that Mr Carr had breached it.
                                                 12  Section 7(3)(b) and 4(a). 13  Section 7(5).   [44] Despite this, I think the Judge had a point.  But that point is more appropriately
framed in terms of the doctrine of equitable estoppel.
[45] The elements of modern estoppel were set out by the Court of Appeal in Wilson
Parking New Zealand Ltd v Fanshawe 136 Ltd:14 In brief, it must be shown that:
(a) a belief or expectation by [party A] has been created or encouraged by
words or conduct by [party B];
(b) to the extent an express representation is relied upon, it is clearly and
unequivocally expressed;
(c) [Party A] reasonably relied to its detriment on the representation; and
(d) it would be unconscionable for [party B] to depart from the belief or
expectation. [46] In this case, Mr Green made an unequivocal representation that he accepted
the altered route of the roadway.  He paid the $5,000 upon its completion.  He
connected it to his land.  He and his family have been using it for nine years.  During
this time Mr Green never made a claim for damages, attempted to cancel the contract,
or sued for specific performance.
[47] Mr Carr clearly relied on Mr Green's representation that he accepted the
construction of the roadway.  He faces detriment in the fact that Mr Green is now
withholding $12,500 from him because Mr Green says he constructed the roadway
incorrectly.  In these circumstances, I consider it would be unconscionable for Mr Carr
to depart from the representation that he accepted the construction of the roadway
along the alternate route, even if Mr Carr did breach the contract.
Conclusion
[48] I have found that Mr Carr was not contractually obliged to construct the
roadway  along  the exact route  designated  in  the  schematic  plan  attached  to  the
contract.
                                                 14  Wilson Parking New Zealand Ltd v Fanshawe 136 Ltd [2014] NZCA 407, [2014] 3 NZLR 567 at
[44] cited with approval in Pollard v Pollard [2016] NZCA 186, (2016) 23 PRNZ 229 at [33].   [49] Even if he was, his failure to do so would not justify Mr Green refusing to
perform the separate obligation of paying him $12,500 for the fencing because the
construction of the roadway was not a condition precedent.
[50] If I am wrong about this, I consider that Mr Green should be estopped from
enforcing his rights under the contract due to his subsequent representation that he
accepted Mr Carr's breach and the other matters in [46].
Result
[51] The appeal is dismissed.
[52] Mr Carr is entitled to costs.  My provisional decision is that costs are to be
calculated on a 2B basis.  If I do not receive prior memoranda to the contrary, that
decision will crystallise in effect at 4:00 pm on 25 January 2019.
