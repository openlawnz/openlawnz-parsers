REASONS OF THE COURT 
 
(Given by Brown J) 
Introduction 
[1] Although  the  discretion  of  an  immigration  officer  under  s  177(1)  of  the 
Immigration  Act  2009  (the  2009  Act)  to  cancel  a  deportation  order  is  stated  to  be 
absolute,1 the officer is nevertheless obliged to consider cancellation if the deportee 
provides information concerning his or her personal circumstances which is relevant 
to  New Zealand's international obligations.2  While  not  obliged  to  give  reasons  for 
the decision to cancel or not cancel a deportation order,3 when an officer does have 
regard to international obligations the officer is required by s 177(5) of the 2009 Act 
to record both a "description of the international obligations" and "the facts about the 
person's personal circumstances". 
[2] At present, Immigration New Zealand's policy to comply with s 177(5) is to 
have immigration officers conduct an interview with potential deportees and fill out 
a Record of Personal Circumstances (RPC) form.4  This form is aimed at eliciting a 
wide  range  of  personal  information  about  the  person.    These  three  appeals  concern 
the  question  whether  the  obligation  in  s 177(5)(b) to record "the facts about the 
person's personal circumstances" is satisfied by the completion of that RPC form or 
whether it  is  necessary  for  a  discrete  record  to  be  made  of  those  aspects  of  the 
person's  personal  circumstances  which  are  specific  to  the  relevant  international 
obligations. 
[3] In Dong  v  The  Chief  Executive  of  the  Ministry  of  Business,  Innovation  and 
Employment 5 and Li v Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment6 it was held 
by Davidson and Davison JJ respectively that  a specific record must be made.  The 
Ministry  of  Business,  Innovation  and  Employment  and  its  Chief  Executive  (the 
                                                 1  Absolute discretion is defined in s 11 of the Immigration Act 2009. 2  Immigration Act 2009, s 177(2). 3  Section 177(4)(a). 4  Discussed further at [5]–[8] below. 5  Dong  v  The  Chief  Executive  of  the  Ministry  of  Business,  Innovation  and  Employment [2016] 
NZHC 1468, [2016] 3 NZLR 357. 6  Li v Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [2016] NZHC 1788.   Ministry)  appeal  those  decisions.    In Fang  v  The  Ministry  of  Business,  Innovation 
and  Employment7 Duffy  J  was  similarly  of  the  opinion  that  a  specific  record  was 
required  but,  because  she  considered  that  she  was  bound  by  the  decision  of  this 
Court   in Singh   v   Chief   Executive,   Ministry of   Business,   Innovation   and 
Employment,8 she ruled to the contrary and held that the completion of the RPC form 
was sufficient.  Mr Fang appeals that decision. 
[4] Hence the primary issues on appeal are whether Singh is determinative of the 
question  and,  if  not,  the  correct  interpretation  of  s  177(5).   Irrespective of  the 
outcome  of  the  appeals,  the  Ministry  also  seeks  to  have  set  aside  a  stay  of 
deportation granted by Davidson J in Dong.9 
The Record of Personal Circumstances form 
[5] As noted above at [2], when a person is liable for deportation it is the policy 
of Immigration New Zealand to conduct an interview with that person and complete 
an RPC form.  It is not a prescribed form but, as the submissions of Mr Carter for the 
Ministry explained,  was  designed  by  officials  with  the  aim  of  eliciting  all  relevant 
information from a potential deportee. 
[6] The RPC form spans 28 pages and comprises 13 sections:   
 
A Record details 
B Person's details 
C Legal representation  
D Caution 
E  Custodial/Non-custodial departure 
F Personal circumstances 
G Personal background 
H Details about the person's immigration status in New Zealand 
I Person's family circumstances 
J Children 
                                                 7  Fang v The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [2016] NZHC 1630. 8  Singh  (Kulbir)  v  Chief  Executive,  Ministry  of  Business,  Innovation  and  Employment [2015] 
NZCA 592, [2016] NZAR 93. 9  Dong, above n 5, at [93].   K Employment history and financial factors 
L Health and special needs 
M Character 
The  form  makes  provision  for  detailed  responses  and  specifies  that  documents  may 
be attached. 
[7] In section B, where the form requires an indication whether or not the person 
liable for deportation is in custody, the person conducting the interview is directed to 
inform  the  proposed  deportee  that  he  or  she  has  the  opportunity  to  provide  the 
interviewer with information about his or her personal circumstances and that, if that 
information is relevant to New Zealand's international obligations, the interviewer 
must consider cancelling the deportation order.  
[8] The final  page  of  the  RPC  form  headed  "Decision"  appears  designed  to 
address the immigration officer's obligations under s 177(5).  This provides a tick-
box to confirm that the person's personal circumstances  have  been  recorded  in  the 
RPC  form.    It  then  requires  the  immigration  officer  to  indicate  whether  or  not  the 
person's circumstances engage New Zealand's international obligations identified as 
being  relevant  to  the  deportation  decision.    If  the  answer to  that  is  affirmative,  the 
officer must list the obligations the officer has considered in making the decision.  In 
all of the cases which have addressed s 177(5), immigration officers have utilised an 
RPC form. 
Factual background 
Mr Dong's interview  
[9] In December   2011   Mr   Dong   entered   New   Zealand   from   China   on   a 
five-month temporary (student) visa which expired in April 2012.  He was arrested at 
a  random  police  check-point  and  served  with  a  deportation  order  in  March  2016.  
Mr Dong  was  interviewed  by  two  compliance  officers  via  an  interpreter  at  the 
Christchurch Central police station on 18 March  2016, at which time the RPC form 
was  completed.    Mr  Dong's  case  was  then  reallocated  to  a  second  immigration   officer for consideration who, on 20 April 2016, completed the "Decision" page and 
determined not to cancel the deportation order. 
[10] The  decision  commenced  with  the  pre-printed  statement,  answered  in  the 
affirmative, that "the facts about the person's personal circumstances are recorded in 
this  template".    The question  whether  Mr  Dong's  circumstances  engaged  New 
Zealand's international obligations identified as being relevant to the deportation 
decision was also answered in the affirmative.   
[11] There  followed  a  handwritten  list  of  various  articles  of  the  International 
Convention  on  Civil  and  Political  Rights  (ICCPR)10 and  the  International  Covenant 
on  Economic,  Social  and  Cultural  Rights  (ICESCR).11  There  was  no  separate 
statement   of   the   facts   which   were   considered   relevant   to   those   international 
obligations. 
[12] The decision concluded with the pre-printed statements: I  have  carefully  considered  the  person's  personal  circumstances  and  any 
applicable international obligations.  
I   am   not   obliged   to   provide   reasons   for   my   decision   by   virtue   of 
section 177(4)(a) of the Immigration Act 2009. Mr Li's interview  
[13] Mr Li arrived in New Zealand in November 2002 on a student visa.  After his 
last  visa  expired  on  9  May  2010  he  remained  unlawfully  in  New  Zealand.    On 
15 October 2012 Mr Li was charged with one count of obtaining an NZQA diploma 
by  deception  and  on  the  same  day  was  served  with  a  deportation  order.    However, 
two days later it was agreed that the enforcement of the deportation order would be 
deferred  pending  determination  of  the  criminal  proceedings.    On  29 April 2015 
Mr Li was found guilty on the charge.   
[14] In  order  to  proceed  with  his  deportation  in  September  2015  Mr  Li  was 
interviewed and an RPC form was completed.  Although the "Decision" page of the 
                                                 10  Namely arts 17 and 23. 11  Articles 6, 7, 10, 11 and 13.   RPC  form  was  left  blank,  a  separate  five-page  document  was  prepared  which 
followed the format of the standard Decision page.   
[15] The decision commenced in the same manner as Mr Dong's.12  It then listed 
60  items  of  information  said  to  be  attached  to  the  decision.    It  identified  as  the 
international obligations to which regard had been had as being:   
(a) three articles of the ICCPR;13 
(b) seven articles of the ICESCR;14 
(c) ten  articles  of  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the 
Child (UNCROC);15 
It concluded with the same two pre-printed statements as in Mr Dong's case.16 
Mr Fang's interview  
[16] Mr  Fang  has  been  unlawfully  in  New  Zealand  since  his  visa  expired  in 
May 2012.    In  August  2015  he  was  apprehended  for  a  traffic  offence,  taken  into 
custody  and  served  with  a  deportation  order.    He  was  interviewed  at  the  Rotorua 
police station on 17 August 2015 at which time an RPC form was completed.  
[17] A  separate  two-page  decision  document  was  completed  by  an  immigration 
officer  and  sent  to  Mr  Fang  via  his  counsel  on  24  August  2015.    The  letter 
accompanying that decision stated that, in reaching the determination, the officer had 
considered  the  information  provided  in  his  interview,  an  interview  with  Mr Fang's 
partner, his counsel's oral submissions of 18 August 2015 and two sets of written 
submissions dated 20 August 2015. 
[18] The decision itself commenced with the following statement: 
                                                 12  At [10] above.  13  Articles 17, 23 and 24.1. 14  Articles 6, 7, 9, 10, 10.3, 11 and 12. 15  Articles 3, 5, 7.1, 8, 12, 16, 18.1, 27.1, 27.2 and 28. 16  At [12] above.   The facts about Mingbo FANG's personal circumstances are recorded in the 
Record of Personal Circumstances, the Interview with [Mr Fang's partner] 
including  counsels  Oral  Submissions,  the  two  sets  of  submissions  dated 
20 August  2015  which  included  [Mr  Fang's  partner's]  Certificate  of 
Citizenship,  Country  Research  Branch  Information  received  in  Response to 
my  request  of  18 August  2015  and  the  further  information  requested  on 
20 August  2015  including  the  information  contained on  the  electronic  links 
and the information contained on immigration file ... . Further information was said to be attached to the decision. 
[19] The  question  concerning  New  Zealand's  international  obligations  was 
answered in the affirmative.  Reference was then made to: 
(a) two articles of the ICCPR;17 
(b) seven articles of the ICESCR;18 
(c) a provision from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;19 
(d) the Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and for 
the Improvement of Mental Health. 
Mr Fang's decision concluded  with  the  same  two  paragraphs  as  in  the  decisions 
involving Messrs Dong and Li.20 
The competing contentions 
[20] Section  177  has  spawned  a  considerable  volume  of  case  law  which  was 
thoroughly canvassed in the written submissions on these appeals.  It will suffice to 
refer  to  two  decisions  of  this  Court  which  recognise  the  constraints  on  judicial 
review in the context of what has been described as the "last ditch" opportunity to 
have a deportation order cancelled.21 
  
                                                 17  Namely arts 17 and 23. 18  Articles 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13. 19  Related to the rights of persons with mental illness. 20  At [12] above. 21  Chief  Executive  of  the  Ministry  of  Business,  Innovation  and  Employment  v  Nair [2010]  NZCA 
248, [2016] NZAR 836 at [30].   [21] First,  with  reference  to  an  immigration officer's  obligation  to  consider 
relevant  obligations  it  was  said  in Chief  Executive  of  the  Ministry  of  Business, 
Innovation and Employment v Liu that:22 Where any [international obligations] are relevant, the officer must record a 
description    of    them    and the  facts  about  the  deportee's  personal 
circumstances.    Manifestly,  s  177  offers  an  inauspicious  setting  for  judicial 
review  but,  as  Whata  J  recognised,  the  courts  may  at  least  review  an 
immigration officer's decision for compliance with these requirements. [22] Second, Singh  v  Chief  Executive,  Ministry  of  Business,  Innovation  and 
Employment reiterated  that  s  177  had  severely  circumscribed  the  scope  for  judicial 
review,  effectively  limiting  it  to  a Wednesbury unreasonableness  inquiry.23  The 
Court  confirmed  that, although  obliged  to  have  regard  to  any  relevant  international 
obligations, an immigration officer was not obliged to give effect to those obligations 
in some particular way or at all. 
[23] However the Court's summary of the features of s 177 concluded: [24] Seventh, to the  extent the [immigration officer] does have  regard to 
international  obligations,  the  [immigration  officer]  is  obliged  to  record  a 
description of them and of the (related) facts about the deportee's personal 
circumstances:  s 177(5). Referencing Liu,   the   Court   observed   that   a   reviewing   Court   can   check   the 
immigration officer's compliance with s 177, particularly s 177(5).24 
The Ministry's case 
[24] It was the Ministry's contention that the numerous judgments in the High 
Court and this Court concerning cases where the RPC form had been utilised meant 
that it had been consistently accepted that the s 177(5)(b) obligation was discharged 
by the completion of that form.  In particular, reference was made to the decision of 
Lang  J  in Babulal v  Chief  Executive,  Department  of  Labour,  which  specifically 
considered the question of whether the RPC form was sufficient to comply with the 
                                                 22  Chief Executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment v Liu [2014] NZCA 37, 
[2014] 2 NZLR 662 at [8] (footnotes omitted). 23  Singh, above n 8, at [46]. 24  At [50].   recording obligation in s 177(5)(b).25  The Judge concluded that it was, determining 
that: [75]  The  section  contemplates  the  immigration  officer  recording  the 
material  facts  upon  which  his  or  her  decision  is  based.    That  can  be  done 
either by recording the facts in narrative form or by listing and/or describing 
the  documents  in  which  the  facts  are  to  be  found.    In  the  present  case  [the 
immigration officer] adopted the later technique. [25] Lang J's approach was followed by Brewer J in Leung v The Chief Executive 
of  the  Ministry  of  Business,  Innovation  and  Employment26 and  Woodhouse  J  in 
Zheng   v   The   Chief   Executive   of   the   Ministry   of   Business,   Innovation   and 
Employment.27  
[26] The Ministry submitted that Dong and Li, together with Duffy J's supportive 
comments  in Fang,  which  instead  followed  the  decision  of  Fogarty  J  in Ewebiyi  v 
Parr,28 were  "outliers".    It supported  the  conclusion  in Fang that the Babulal 
approach had been confirmed, albeit implicitly, in this Court's judgment in Singh.29  
It contended that: 
(a) the effect of Dong and Li and the argument advanced in Fang was that 
an  immigration  officer  would  be  required  to  identify   and  select 
specific facts  out  of  all  the  information  provided  by  the  potential 
deportee   and   then   relate   those   facts   to   a   specific   international 
obligation; 
(b) it was unlikely that, simply by the use of the words "related" and 
"relevant", this Court in Singh had  intended  to  depart  from,  let  alone 
overrule,  Brewer  J's  views  on  the  scope  of  s  177(5).    The  better 
inference  was  said  to  be  that  this  Court  did  not  consider  the Babulal 
                                                 25  Babulal  v  Chief  Executive,  Department  of  Labour HC  Auckland  CIV-2011-404-1773,  29 
September 2011. 26  Leung  v  The  Chief  Executive  of  the  Ministry  of  Business,  Innovation  and  Employment [2013] 
NZHC 1158 at [15]. 27  Zheng  v  The  Chief  Executive  of  the  Ministry  of  Business,  Innovation  and  Employment [2013] 
NZHC 1257 at [10]. 28  Ewebiyi v Parr HC Christchurch CIV-2011-409-2010, 7 December 2011. 29  Singh (CA), above n 7.   approach  was  inconsistent  with  the  obligation  to  record  relevant  or 
related facts. 
(c) the  correlation  of  potentially  different  facts  to  individual  international 
obligations would reveal an immigration officer's thought processes 
and  would  be  tantamount  to  imposing  an  obligation  to  give  reasons; 
and 
(d) section 177 reflected Parliament's recognition of the impracticality  of 
requiring  immigration  officers  to  do  so,  in  particular  by  the  exclusion 
of an obligation to give reasons in s 177(4)(a). 
[27] The implications of a rejection of the Ministry's contention were dramatically 
depicted: There  are  considerable  downstream  ramifications  for  proper  administration 
of the deportation provisions of the immigration legislation.  If [immigration 
officers] at the "last-ditch stage" of the immigration process are required to 
produce  a  formal  statement  isolating  and  summarising  relevant  facts  and 
identifying  the  particular  obligations  that  are  engaged  by  those  facts,  the 
process  will  be  slowed  to  the  point  of  institutional  paralysis.    [Immigration 
officers] (who are not required to have legal or other tertiary qualifications) 
would  require  legal  advice  before  finalising  any  deportation  decision,  there 
would be considerably greater scope for legal challenges, a higher volume of 
immigration  cases  would  go  through  the  courts,  consequential  litigation 
delays and the inevitable passage of time in individual cases will favour the 
unlawfully present. The arguments for Messrs Fang, Dong and Li 
[28] The  common  theme  in  the  submissions  for  Messrs  Fang,  Dong  and  Li  was 
that, while immigration officers were not required to compile a statement of facts in 
the  manner  of  a  court  or  tribunal  giving  a  reasoned  decision,  s 177(5)(b)  clearly 
imposes an obligation to prepare a statement of relevant facts separate from the RPC 
form.  Further, it was submitted for all parties that this Court's decision in Singh was 
not  binding,  nor  did  it  specifically  determine  the  issue  under  appeal  here.    The 
sequence  of  High  Court  decisions,  including Babulal,30 Leung31 and Zheng,32 all  of 
                                                 30  Babulal, above n 25. 31  Leung, above n 26. 32  Zheng, above n 27.   which preceded the judgments under appeal, were explained as having been not fully 
argued and decided prior to this Court's decision in Singh.  
[29] On  the  issue  of  the  mode  of  compliance  with  s  177(5)(b)  there  was  some 
divergence  between  the  parties.    For  Mr  Li,  Mr  Kilian  accepted  that  the  example 
provided  by  Davidson  J  in Dong,33 and  echoed  by  Davison  J in Li,34 was  sufficient 
compliance.    Mr Zhang,  however,  for  Messrs Fang  and  Dong  contended  that  the 
stated  facts  should  be  separately  listed  in  respect  of  each  international  obligation 
described. 
[30] Furthermore,  despite  the  absence  of  any  cross-appeal,  Mr  Zhang's  oral 
submissions explored the requirement for a description of international obligations in 
s 177(5)(a).  He contended that it was not sufficient simply to list the article number 
of a particular convention or treaty but that the word "description" necessitated  a 
brief summary of the content of the particular obligation. 
Was the issue determined by this Court in Singh? 
[31] Although  Duffy  J  preferred  the  approach  in Ewebiyi,  she  considered  herself 
bound by Singh, explaining:35 [26] The  expressed  reasoning  of the  Court  of Appeal  in Singh approved 
Lang J's general approach in Babulal.   The  Court  of Appeal  also  expressly 
found  that  there  was  no  error  in  Brewer  J's  approach;  this  was  in 
circumstances  where  the  s  177  decision  took  the  same  form  as  the  s  177 
decision in Babulal, and the approach adopted by Brewer J was the same as 
that  taken  by  Lang  J  in Babulal.   This  causes  me  to  conclude  that  I  should 
find that a s 177 decision which follows the form of the decision in Babulal 
will comply  with  the  requirements  of s  177,  and  in  particular  s  177(5).   As 
the  decision  under  review  does  this,  I  find  that  it  was  not  made  in  error  of 
law.  [32] However this Court's consideration in Singh was  confined  to  the  issues  live 
on    that    appeal,    namely    whether    Brewer    J    erred    in    declining    to    allow 
cross-examination of the immigration officer and whether the Judge's approach to 
review of the s 177 decision was erroneous.36  In finding no error in the first instance 
                                                 33  Dong, above n 5, at [49]. 34  Li, above n 6, at [57]. 35  Fang, above n 7. 36  Singh, above n 8, at [3].   decision the Court expressed agreement with the Judge's reasoning only in relation 
to the immigration officer's consideration of the child's situation and the Judge's 
decision declining to allow cross-examination.  The Court's endorsement of Babulal 
was directed to the extremely limited scope for judicial review under s 177.37   
[33] As Professor A L Goodhart explained in his description of ratio decidendi, the 
principle of a case is found by taking account of (a) the facts treated by the Judge as 
material and (b) the Judge's decision as based on them.38  While  in Singh an  RPC 
form  was  completed  and  there  was  no  separate  record  of  facts  relevant  to  the 
international  obligations  identified,  this  Court  did  not  express  a  conclusion  on  the 
meaning of s 177(5)(b) or make any decision as to its application to the facts because 
that was not a live issue on appeal. 
[34] In our view the judgment of Davison J in Li provides the correct analysis  of 
the scope of this Court's finding in Singh:39 [60] I respectfully disagree with Duffy J's view that Lang J's view on the 
[immigration  officer's]  recording  obligation   in Babulal was   explicitly 
approved  by  the  Court  of Appeal  in Singh and  that  therefore  this  Court  is 
bound by it.  Although the Court of Appeal did approve Lang J's comments 
about the "extremely limited" scope of judicial review under s 177 generally, 
nothing was said about his Honour's interpretation of what is required of an 
[immigration officer] by s 177(5).  Indeed, the issue in Singh did not require 
the  Court  to  consider  the  scope  of  an  [immigration  officer's]  recording 
obligation under s 177(5), and consequently, in my view the Court of Appeal 
cannot  be  said  to  have  spoken  about  and  provided  direct  authority  on  the 
issue. [35] The only observations in Singh touching on s 177(5) were obiter dicta.  Those 
observations  emphasised  the  need  for  a  relationship  between  the  recorded  facts  and 
the  international  obligations  described.40  Hence,  we  do  not  consider  that Singh is 
binding authority on the issue of the construction of s 177(5)(b), and, in any case, in 
fact it points in the direction taken in both Dong and Li. 
[36] Accordingly, we turn to interpret the meaning of s 177(5)(b) afresh. 
                                                 37  At [44]–[46]. 38  A  L  Goodhart Essays  in  Jurisprudence  and  the  Common  Law (Cambridge  University  Press, 
London, 1931) at 25.  39  Li, above n 6. 40  Singh, above n 8, at [24] and [64].   Interpretation of s 177(5)(b) 
[37] It is necessary to view the subsection in the context of the section as a whole, 
in particular the "trigger" to consideration of cancellation of a deportation  order  in 
subs (2),41 and  the  extent  of  the  consequential  obligation  to  consider  relevant 
international obligations in subs (3).  For that reason we set s 177 out in full: 177  Deportation order may be cancelled 
(1)  An immigration officer may, in his or her absolute discretion, cancel 
a deportation order served on a person to whom section 154 applies. 
(2)  Nothing  in  subsection  (1)  gives  a  person  a  right  to  apply  for  the 
cancellation of a deportation order. However, an immigration officer 
must consider cancelling the deportation order of a person who is in 
New  Zealand  if  the  person  provides  information  to  the  officer 
concerning his or her personal circumstances, and the information is 
relevant to New Zealand's international obligations. 
(3)  If  an  immigration  officer  does  consider  cancelling  a  deportation 
order,  whether  by  way  of a  purported  application  or his  or  her  own 
motion,  the  officer  must  have  regard  to  any  relevant  international 
obligations, but otherwise— 
(a) may make a decision as he or she thinks fit; and 
(b)  in   doing   so,   is   not   under   any   obligation,   whether   by 
implication or otherwise,— 
(i)  to  apply  any  test  or  any  particular  test  and,  in 
particular, the officer is not obliged to apply the test 
set out in section 207; or 
(ii)  to inquire into the  circumstances of, or to make  any 
further   inquiry    in   respect   of    the   information 
provided  by  or  in  respect  of,  the  person  who  is  the 
subject of the deportation order or any other person. 
(4)  Whether   or   not   an   immigration   officer   considers   cancelling   a 
deportation order,— 
(a)  he  or  she  is  not  obliged  to  give  reasons  for  any  decision, 
other than the reason that this subsection applies; and 
(ab)  privacy  principle  6  (which  relates  to  access  to  personal 
information  and  is  set  out  in section  6 of  the  Privacy  Act 
1993) does not apply to any reasons for any decision relating 
to the purported application; and                                                  41  Singh, above n 8, at [16].   (b)  section  23 of  the  Official  Information  Act  1982  does  not 
apply in respect of the decision. 
(5)  However, to the extent that an immigration officer does have regard 
to any international obligations, the officer is obliged to record— 
(a)  a description of the international obligations; and 
(b)  the facts about the person's personal circumstances. [38] The meaning of s 177(5) is to be ascertained from its text and in the light of 
its purpose.42  As the Supreme Court observed in Commerce Commission v Fonterra 
Co-operative  Group  Ltd,  in  determining  purpose  the  Court  must  obviously  have 
regard  to  both  the  immediate  and  the  general  legislative  context.43  The  social, 
commercial or other objective of the enactment may also be relevant. 
Text 
[39] The  obligation  in  s  177(5)  is  a  recording  function.    It  was  common  ground 
that the verb "record" was used in the ordinary sense that has gained prominence in 
modern  usage,  namely  to  set  down  in  writing  in  some  permanent  form.    An 
immigration  officer  is  required  by  s  177(5)  to  make  such  a  notation  of  the  two 
specified  matters  only  when,  and  to  the  extent  that,  the  officer  has  had  regard  to 
New Zealand's international obligations in  the  course  of  the  s  177  process.    It  is 
instructive  to  consider  the  section  both  in  its  entirety  and  in  the  context  of  the 
2009 Act.   
[40] So  far  as  the  latter  is  concerned,  it  will  suffice  to  refer  to  the  three  points 
which  this  Court  in Singh identified  as emerging  from  the  framework  of  the  2009 
Act:44   
(a) The  2009  Act  aims  to  balance  New  Zealand's  interest  (in  not 
permitting people to be in New Zealand unlawfully) with the right of 
individuals. 
                                                 42  Interpretation Act 1999, s 5(1). 43  Commerce  Commission  v  Fonterra  Co-operative  Group  Ltd [2007]  NZSC  36,  [2007]  3  NZLR 
767 at [22]. 44  Singh, above n 8, at [12]–[14].   (b) Part  6  of  the  2009 Act,  dealing  with  deportation,  has  the  purpose of 
supporting the integrity of New Zealand's immigration system. 
(c) Section  177,  which  is  positioned  toward  the  end  of  pt  6  after  ss  175 
and 175A but before s 178 (which is headed "executing deportation 
order"),  provides  a  last-ditch   opportunity   to   have   cancelled   a 
deportation   order   made   as   a   result   of   the   detailed   and   careful 
deportation process set out in pt 6. 
[41] Turning  to  the  structure  of  s  177,  subs  (1)  and  the  first  sentence  of  subs  (2) 
maintain respectively both the officer's entitlement to cancel a deportation order and 
the absence of any entitlement for the deportee to apply for same.  That reflects the 
position  as  originally  introduced  by  s  52A  of  the  Immigration Act  1987  (the  1987 
Act).45   
[42] The  officer's  absolute  discretion  is  then  qualified  in  the  event  that  the 
deportee  provides  information  concerning  the  deportee's  personal  circumstances 
which information is relevant to New Zealand's international obligations.  In that 
event  the  immigration  officer  is  obliged  to  consider  cancellation  of  the  deportation 
order.46 
[43] On  such  consideration  the  immigration  officer  must  have  regard  to  any 
relevant  international  obligations  but  otherwise  may  make  such  decision  as  the 
officer   thinks   fit.47  Subsection   (4)   preserves   the   exemption   as   provided   in 
s 52A(3)(b)(i)  of  the  1987 Act  from  an  obligation  to  give  reasons  for  any  decision 
reached by the officer on consideration of cancellation.   
[44] Subsection  (5)  then  introduces  the  second  qualification  by  imposing  an 
obligation to make a record of specified matters when, in discharging the obligation 
in subs (3), the officer has had regard to any relevant international obligations.   
[45] From that structure we distil the following points in relation of s 177: 
                                                 45  As introduced by s 23 of the Immigration Amendment Act 1991. 46  Immigration Act, s 177(2). 47  Section 177(3).   (a) The  trigger  to  an  immigration  officer's  obligation  to  consider 
cancellation is the provision by a deportee of information concerning 
the  deportee's  personal  circumstances  which  is  relevant  to  one  or 
more of New Zealand's international obligations. 
(b) It is those obligations to which the immigration officer "must then 
have regard" under  subs  (3),  a  phrase  which,  as  noted  in Singh,48 it 
can confidently be said Parliament selected deliberately. 
(c) The description of the international obligations which an immigration 
officer is obliged to record under subs (5)(a) are only such obligations 
as are rendered relevant by the deportee's provision of information in 
subs (2).   
(d) The  facts  which  an  immigration  officer  is  obliged  to  record  under 
subs  (5)(b)  are  only  those  pertaining  to  the  deportee's  personal 
circumstances which triggered the obligation to consider international 
obligations.   This  Court  in Singh described them as "related" facts.49  
We agree with Davison J in Li that the use of the phrase "facts about" 
the deportee's personal circumstances was a considered choice which 
serves to emphasise the focussed task in subs 5(b).50   
(e) The  sequence  in  the  required  recording  of  the  description  of  the 
international  obligations  followed  by  the  related  facts  is  in  itself 
significant.  As Fogarty J observed in Ewebiyi:51 Relevance  is  a  qualifier  applied  to  facts  which  are  made 
relevant    by    considering    them    against    the    relevant 
international  obligations.    That  is  why  subs  (5)  naturally 
orders: (a) international obligations, before (b) facts.   (f) There  is  a  relationship  between  the  two  matters  which  the  officer  is 
obliged  to  record.   We  consider  the  legislature  intended  that  the  task 
                                                 48  Singh, above n 8, at [17]. 49  At [24]. 50  Li, above n 6, at [74]–[75]. 51  Ewebiyi, above n 28, at [57].   of  recording  those  matters  would  be  undertaken  once  the  officer  had 
concluded his consideration of cancellation. 
[46] A consideration of the text of s 177 leads us to conclude that, notwithstanding 
that  an  immigration  officer  is  not  required  to  give  reasons  for  a  decision  on 
considering  cancellation  of  a  deportation  order,  the  officer  is  directed  to  make  a 
specific notation which both describes any New Zealand international obligations to 
which  the  officer  has  had  regard  pursuant  to  s  177(3)  and  then  states  the  facts 
concerning  the  deportee's  personal  circumstances  which  prompted  the  officer's 
reference to those international obligations. 
[47] In the normal course we would expect that the record of such facts would be 
a small subset of the information which a deportee is likely to provide in response to 
the range of questions in the RPC form.  We do not consider that compiling a record 
of those pertinent facts should be an onerous task.  On that issue we  agree with the 
observations of Davidson J in Dong:52 [49] A decision about the facts is  expressly not required,  but a record of 
"the facts", if there are any, is expressly required.  This might be a brief 
statement along the lines: 
Information about the applicant's personal relationships included: 
 his partnership and marriage to Ms Liu 
 the future of that relationship should he be deported to China ... 
(etc). [48] Hence we do not accept the proposition advanced in the Ministry's notices of 
appeal  in Dong and Li that  the  judgments  under  appeal  required  the  officer  to 
separately  summarise  and  record  facts  stated  to  be  relevant  to  specific  international 
obligations "in the manner of a court or tribunal making formal findings of fact".  
While framed as a qualification, s 177(5) does not impose on an officer an obligation 
to  give  reasons  for  his  or  her  decision  on  the  issue  of  cancellation  of  a  deportation 
order. 
                                                 52  Dong, above n 5.   [49] Nor  do  we  endorse  the  suggestion  that  the  record  of  pertinent  facts  must 
involve  a  distinct  list  of  facts specific  to  each  international  obligation  identified  as 
stated as the first issue in the agreed list of issues on appeal: Is   the   obligation   on   an   immigration   officer   under   s   177(5)   of   the 
Immigration Act 2009 to record facts about a potential deportee's personal 
circumstances satisfied by completing the Record of Personal Circumstances 
form during and after interview of the potential deportee, including by list or 
description  of  documents  in  which  the  facts  may  be  found OR is  the 
immigration  officer  required  to  select  and  record  particular  facts  which  the 
immigration  officer  considers  to  be  relevant  to  each  specific  international 
obligation. [50] Accordingly,  we  reject  what  was  ultimately  the  Ministry's  primary 
submission that, because the pertinent facts are a subset of the information compiled 
in  the  RPC  form,  it  must  follow  that  the  recording  of  the  information  in  that  form 
necessarily also involves the recording of the requisite facts.   
[51] Our  view  is  that  the  recorded  facts  contemplated  by  subs  (5)(b)  are  those 
which bear on the international obligations the subject of the description required by 
subs  (5)(a).    We  do  not  consider  that  the  direction  to  compile  a  record  of  those 
specific  facts  is  achieved  by  the  compilation  of  a  much  more  extensive  document 
(namely the RPC form, together with any annexures), which may comprise a variety 
of  statements,  observations  and  even  expressions  of  opinion,  which  are  not  facts  as 
envisaged  by  subs (5)(b)  or  even  facts  at  all.    The  well-known  haystack  metaphor 
springs to mind. 
[52] Similarly,  we  do  not  accept  that  purporting  to  provide  a  record  of  the 
pertinent  facts  by  the  adoption  of  the  technique  of  a  reference  back  to  the  entire 
contents of the RPC form, which Davidson J described as "record of the record",53 is 
an adequate discharge of the obligation imposed on the officer by subs (5)(b). 
Purpose — the cross-check 
[53] The introduction of the obligation to record the s 177(5) matters needs to be 
viewed in the context of Parliament's negation of the Supreme Court's holding in Ye 
                                                 53  At [38].   v Minister of Immigration.54  The 1987 Act had made provision for the cancellation 
of  removal  orders  by  immigration  officers  since  1991.   A  deportee  had  no  right  to 
apply for cancellation and the immigration officer had no obligation to give reasons 
for the decision.  In Ye v Minister of Immigration the Supreme Court held that it was 
necessary  to  apply  the  s 47(3)  test55 at  the  last  stage  of  the  removal  or  deportation 
process.  However as this Court observed in Parmanadan v Minister of Immigration, 
the  subsequent  amendment  to  s  58  (and  the  introduction  of  s 177  of  the  2009 Act) 
represented a sharp legislative rejection of the Supreme Court's ruling in Ye.56  
[54] The  circumstances  are  conveniently  recorded  in Chief  Executive  of  the 
Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment v Nair:57 [34] ... s 177 was inserted (as cl 165A) by a supplementary order paper 
following the select committee recommendation that the Bill should include 
a provision for cancellation of a deportation order.  The supplementary order 
paper explains  the  wording  of  s  177  was  a  response to  the  judgment  of  the 
Supreme  Court  in Ye  v  Minister  of  Immigration,  which  was  delivered  after 
the   select   committee   stage   and   second   reading   of   the   Bill.      The 
supplementary order paper in Committee included two clauses responding to 
that decision.  One was cl 165A, which became s 177; the other was cl 432, 
which amended s 58 of the 1987 Act. 
[35] The explanatory note to the paper discusses these changes: 
... new  clauses  165A and 432 are  inserted,  to  ensure  that  certain 
decisions  (for  example,  decisions  about  whether  or  not  a  person 
liable  for  deportation  (or  removal  under  the  Immigration Act  1987) 
from  New  Zealand  should  be  deported  (or  removed))  are  decisions 
made  by  immigration  officers  implementing  the  practical  elements 
of the final stage of removal of the person and do not require any test 
or  any  particular  test.    In  particular,  immigration  officers  are  not 
required to apply the test set out in section 47(3) of the Immigration 
Act  1987  or  in clause  186 of  the  Bill,  as  the  case  may  be,  when 
considering  cancellation  of  a  removal  order  or  a  deportation  order.  
At  this  stage,  the  essential  legal  issue  is  whether  the  person  is  in 
New  Zealand  unlawfully.    These  amendments  overturn  the  future 
effect  of  most  of  the  key  findings  (including  the  findings  that 
required  immigration  officers  to  apply  the  humanitarian  appeal  test 
and imposed duties of inquiry on them) in the recent Supreme Court 
decisions Ye   v   Minister   of   Immigration;   Qiu   v   Minister   of 
Immigration  ...,  and Huang  v  Minister of  Immigration ...,  all                                                  54  Ye v Minister of Immigration [2009] NZSC 76, [2010] 1 NZLR 104. 55  Requiring  a  consideration  of  whether  there  are  exceptional  circumstances  of  a  humanitarian 
nature   that   would   make  it  unjust  or  unduly   harsh   for  the  person  to  be  removed  from 
New Zealand. 56  Parmanadan v Minister of Immigration [2010] NZCA 136, [2010] NZAR 424 at [7]. 57  Nair, above n 21 (footnotes and citations omitted).   judgments  being  delivered  on  20  July  2009.    The  amendments, 
however, do not affect the position of the litigants in those decisions. [55] In  addition to curbing the impact of the Supreme Court decisions, the new s 
177  imposed  an  obligation  on  immigration  officers  to  have  regard  to  such  of 
New Zealand's international obligations as were identified as relevant to the personal 
circumstances of a proposed deportee and to make a record of the facts about those 
circumstances and the relevant international obligations.   
[56] In explaining the government's concern the speech on behalf of the Minister 
of Immigration during the Third Reading of the Immigration Bill 2007 (132-3) drew 
specific  attention  to  the  legislative  requirement  for  immigration  officers  to  take 
account  of  New  Zealand's  international  obligations  when  executing  deportation 
orders:58 The Government was concerned about the practical implications of a recent 
Supreme  Court  decision  that  required  a  complex  humanitarian  test  to  be 
applied by immigration officers at the final point of removing an overstayer.  
That  is  why  the  Government's  Supplementary  Order  Paper  32  included 
amendments to the Immigration Act 1987 in relation to the cancellation of a 
removal order, and to the provisions in the bill relating to the cancellation of 
a  deportation order.  There is  a formal process that allows  most overstayers 
to  lodge  a  humanitarian  appeal  within  42  days  of  becoming  overstayers  if 
there  is  good  reason  they  should  not  leave  New  Zealand.    The  time  for 
overstayers  to raise  concerns  is  not  at the  last  minute  before they  board  the 
plane.  Expecting an immigration officer to apply a complex legal case at the 
time  is  just  not  practical.    However,  immigration  officers  will  still  take 
account  of  New  Zealand's  recent  relevant  international  obligations  when 
executing  removal  or  deportation  orders,  if  an  overstayer  gives  information 
relevant to those obligations to the officers.  The amendments to the bill have 
made this clear. [57] The penultimate sentence referred to the obligation in s 177(3) to have regard 
to  any  relevant  international  obligations.    The  sentences  which  precede  it  note  the 
context  in  which  decisions  on  cancellation  of  removal  orders  are  considered  and 
serve to explain why immigration officers are not obliged to make such decisions in 
accordance  with  international  obligations  and  are  not  required  to  give  reasons  for 
their decisions. 
                                                 58  (29 October 2009) 658 NZPD 7638.   [58] Although the recording  obligation in s 177(5) is  framed  as a qualification to 
the  preceding  subsection,  we  do  not  consider that  it  was  intended  to  impose  an 
obligation on immigration officers to give reasons.  Rather we infer that the purpose 
of the subsection is to cause a record to be made that New Zealand's international 
obligations  have  in  fact  been  considered  by  an  immigration  officer  when  the 
circumstances render them relevant to a cancellation decision. 
[59] As  noted  by  this  Court  in Liu59 and Singh,60 the  consequence  of  a  record 
being made of the international obligations considered by an immigration officer and 
the  related  facts  would  enable  the  Court  on  review  to  at  least  be  satisfied  that  the 
obligation  imposed  by  s 177(3)  had  been  addressed,  albeit  not  discharged  in  some 
particular manner. 
[60] We agree therefore with the Ministry's submissions that the purpose of the 
subsection is not to send a message about the manner of New Zealand's compliance 
with its international obligations but to ensure that the performance of the obligation 
is discharged and to provide the Court with a real, but limited, degree of scrutiny of 
such performance. 
[61] Consequently the identified purpose of subs (5) aligns with our interpretation 
of the subsection by reference to the text of s 177. 
Conclusion 
[62] In  circumstances  where  an  immigration  officer  is  required  to  have  regard  to 
New Zealand's international obligations in the course of considering the cancellation 
of  a  deportation  order,  the  officer  is  required  to  make  a  specific  record  of  the  facts 
which prompted reference to those obligations. 
[63] The  record  of  facts  may  be  succinct  in  the  manner  discussed  at [47] above.  
The facts need not be marshalled by reference to individual international obligations.  
However it must be a record dedicated to the function of stating the facts relevant to 
the  international  obligations  to  which  the  immigration  officer  has  had  regard.    A 
                                                 59  Liu, above n 22, at [8]. 60  Singh, above n 8, at [50].    completed RPC form will not suffice as the record required by s 177(5)(b), nor will a 
mere cross-reference to a RPC form or other listed documents.  To permit otherwise 
would  defeat  the  purpose  of  the  provision  which  is  to  ensure  that  the  fact  of 
consideration  of  New  Zealand  international  obligations  is  both  transparent  and 
amenable to judicial review.   
[64] We  do  not  consider  that  the  Ministry's  apprehensions  concerning  the 
ramifications of our interpretation of the provision are justified.61  In introducing this 
procedure the Minister of Immigration recognised that it is not practical to expect an 
immigration officer to apply a complex legal case at the point of deportation.62  That 
reality  is  reflected  in  the  power  to  make  such  decision  on  cancellation  as  the 
immigration  officer  thinks  fit  together  with  the  absence  of  any  obligation  to  give 
reasons for the decision. 
[65] However, specific provision was made to impose on immigration officers the 
obligation to take account of New Zealand's international obligations when relevant 
information is provided by deportees.  While noting the Ministry's submission that 
immigration officers are not required to have legal or other tertiary qualifications, we 
do not consider that our interpretation of that obligation as imposed by s 177(5)(b) is 
unduly  onerous.    In  order  for  an  immigration  officer  to  conclude  that  he  or  she  is 
required to have regard to some international obligation, it will be necessary for the 
officer  to  have  identified  facts  which  caused  that  international  obligation  to  be 
relevant to the particular case.  All that s 177(5)(b) requires is that those facts which 
triggered  consideration  of  the  international  obligation  should  be  recited.    No 
additional analysis is required. 
Substantive relief 
[66] In Dong and Li, upon the successful judicial review challenge, Davidson and 
Davison  JJ  respectively  remitted  the  matters  back  to  the  Ministry  to  enable  the 
immigration officer who had the conduct of the  deportation process to comply with 
the  obligation  under  s  177(5).63  The  third  of  the  agreed  issues  on  appeal  was 
                                                 61  Set out at [27] above. 62  At [56] above. 63  Dong, above n 5, at [92]; and Li, above n 6, at [118]–[119].   whether  that  substantive  relief  should  have  been  withheld  in  the  exercise  of 
discretion.  
[67] By analogy with the considerations relevant to interim relief discussed below, 
the Ministry submitted that, in the event the appeals in Dong and Li were dismissed 
and  the Fang appeal  allowed,  relief  should  be  withheld.    The  Ministry  recognised 
that, even though public law remedies are discretionary, some circumstances require 
extremely  strong reasons  to  decline  relief  where  a  public  decision  maker  has  been 
shown to have erred in the exercise of the decision making power.64   
[68] In  these  appeals  the  extremely  strong  reasons  were  said  to  be  the  same 
features  of  the  statutory  scheme  that  make  it  difficult  to  obtain  interim  relief  to 
prevent  deportation,  namely  that  it  would  be  unlikely  for  any  visa  to  be  granted  in 
any case, unless each of Messrs Fang, Dong and Li were to depart New Zealand and 
re-apply from offshore. 
[69] An alternative argument was advanced that, even if we ultimately found some 
procedural error in the immigration officers' application of s 177, no relief should be 
given on the basis that it is highly unlikely that any of the three deportees would be 
granted a visa so long as they remained in New Zealand.  
[70] We consider that the Ministry's submission erroneously seeks to merge the 
issue  of  relief  on  the  substantive  question  with  the  issue  of  interim  relief  discussed 
below.    We  do  not  accept  that  because  interim  relief  may  be  declined  the  Court 
should  refuse  to  entertain  the  grant  of  meaningful  relief  with  reference  to  the 
observance of the statutory process.   
[71] In  the  absence  of  a  suitably  qualifying  record  of  the  trigger  facts  and  the 
relevant international obligations, it is not possible for the Court to assess the merits 
or  otherwise  of  the  challenges  to  the  decisions.    The  enforcement  of  the  proper 
discharge  of  that  obligation  should  not  be  dependent  on  the  happenstance  of  the 
residence of the applicants for the time being. 
                                                 64  Air  Nelson  Limited  v  Minister  of  Transport [2008]  NZCA  26,  [2008]  NZAR  139  at  [59]–[61]; 
and Survey Nelson Ltd v Maritime New Zealand [2010] NZCA 629 at [52].   [72] For  the  reasons  given  by  Davidson  J65 and  Davison  J66 we  consider  that  the 
record required by s 177(5)(b) should be compiled.  The same applies to Mr Fang's 
case.   In all three decisions under appeal the matter is to be remitted back to enable 
the immigration officer who had conduct of the process to comply with the recording 
obligation as set out in this judgment. 
Section 177(5)(a) 
[73] Although   not   foreshadowed   in   his   written   submissions,   Mr   Zhang   for 
Messrs Fang  and  Dong  invited  the  Court  to  also  consider  the  interpretation  of 
s 177(5)(a).  He contended that it was not a sufficient description of the international 
obligation merely to refer to an article in a convention or treaty. 
[74] We  agree  that  simply  to  provide  a  list  of  article  or  paragraph  numbers  of  an 
international instrument would not be sufficient compliance with the requirement to 
provide a "description" of the international obligations.  In our view, the employment 
of  that  word  indicates  that  some  indication  of  the  substance  of  the  particular 
obligation is required rather than merely identifying the applicable provision number.  
However, it will not be necessary to set out the full text of the particular obligation; a 
paraphrase  of  the  primary  content  of  the  obligation  will  generally  be  a  sufficient 
description for the purposes of the subsection. 
[75] In  our  view  the  obligation  was  properly  discharged  in  the  forms  of  decision 
involving  both  Messrs  Dong  and  Li.    For  example,  the  international  obligations 
referred to in Mr Dong's case were: International Convention on Civil and Political Rights ("ICCPR") 
- not  to  be  subjected  to  arbitrary  or  unlawful  interference  with  family:  
art 17  
- family,   natural   and   fundamental   group   unit   of   society,   entitled   to 
protection by society and state:  art 23 
International   Covenant   on   Economic,   Social,   and   Cultural   [R]ights 
("ICESCR") 
- the right to work:  art 6                                                  65  Dong, above n 5, at [51] and [92]. 66  Li, above n 6, at [118]–[119].   - the right to work in just and favourable conditions:  art 7 
- widest  possible  protection  and  assistance  should  be  given  to  family 
which is natural and fundamental group unit of society:  art 10 
- an adequate standard of living, adequate food, clothing and housing: art 
11 
- the right to education:  art 13 The  same  level  of  description  was  provided  in  respect  of  Mr  Li,  the  only  material 
difference being the article number preceded the summary of the relevant provision. 
[76] The  decision  in  respect  of  Mr  Fang  adopted  the  same  format  as  that  in 
Mr Li's  case.    While  the  descriptions  of  the  obligations  in  the  ICCPR  and  the 
ICESCR  were  slightly  more  abbreviated,  they  were  still  sufficient  descriptions  for 
the  purposes  of  the  provision.    The  decision  also  referred  to  two  international 
instruments which had been noted in communications from Mr Fang's legal adviser, 
namely: Universal Declaration of Human Rights:  every person with a mental illness 
shall  have  the  right  to  exercise  all  civil,  political,  social  and  cultural  rights 
recognised 
Principles  for  the  Protection  of  Persons  with  Mental  [I]llness  and  for  the 
Improvement of Mental Health [77] In  the  case  of  the  former  it  would  have  been  desirable  but  not  mandatory  to 
identify  the  particular  provision  by  number.    We  consider  that  the  latter  was 
unhelpfully vague and that reference should have been made to a specific obligation 
or obligations.  However, given the way in which this issue has arisen, we make no 
directions concerning compliance with s 177(5)(a). 
Interim relief 
[78] The  second  agreed  issue  on  appeal  was  whether  interim  orders  preventing 
deportation were correctly granted and continued in Dong.  Given our conclusion on 
the  primary  issue,  the  question  becomes  whether  interim  relief  should  be  granted 
pending the completion of the record on the remission back to the decision-maker.   [79] Invoking  the  principles  explained  in Parmanadan,67 the  Ministry  submitted 
that  having  regard  to  the  statutory  scheme  including  its  emphasis  on  personal 
responsibility,  the  usual  statutory   effects  of  deportation  will  not  generally  be 
sufficiently adverse to meet the threshold for interim relief because it does not follow 
that  a  visa  of  one  kind  or  another  would  ultimately  be  granted  consequent  on  the 
completion of the record required by s 177(5). 
[80] Mr  Zhang  countered  that  the  time  has  come  to  overrule Parmanadan.    He 
submitted   that   the   Court   should   reinstate   the   earlier   approach   in Esekielu   v 
Attorney-General,68 which applied the classic interim relief principles from Carlton 
&  United  Breweries  Ltd  v  Minister  of  Customs69 and American  Cyanamid  Co  v 
Ethicon Limited.70 
[81] However, the approach in Parmanadan has since been followed by this Court 
in Nair71 and  recently  reiterated  in Minhas  v  An  Immigration  Officer.72  We  do  not 
accept that there is any justification for revisiting the now well-established approach.  
The removal of Messrs  Fang,  Dong and  Li from New  Zealand can have  no bearing 
on the way in which the respective immigration officers complete their task under s 
177(5)(b).  Nor will the fact that Messrs Fang, Dong and Li are out of New Zealand 
affect  any  entitlement  to  seek  review  of  the  actions  of  the  officers  pursuant  to  the 
orders for remission. 
[82] Accordingly, the interim order staying Mr Dong's deportation  pending  the 
remission back to the relevant immigration officer is set aside. 
Result 
[83] The appeal in CA369/2016 is allowed.  The decision is to be remitted back to 
the  Ministry  of  Business,  Innovation  and  Employment  to  enable  the  immigration 
officer who had the conduct of the deportation process to comply with the obligation 
under s 177(5) as set out in this judgment. 
                                                 67  Parmanadan, above n 56, at [8]–[11]. 68  Esekielu v Attorney-General (1993) 6 PRNZ 309 (HC). 69  Carlton & United Breweries Ltd v Minister of Customs [1986] 1 NZLR 423 (CA). 70  American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Limited [1975] AC 396 (HL). 71  Nair, above n 21, at [19]. 72  Minhas v An Immigration Officer [2016] NZCA 435, [2016] NZAR 1419 at [35]–[36].   [84] The  appeal  in  CA370/2016  is  allowed  in  part.    The  interim  order staying 
Mr Dong's  deportation  pending  the  remission  back  to  the  relevant  immigration 
officer is set aside. 
[85] The appeal in CA423/2016 is dismissed.  
[86] The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment must pay Mr Li costs 
for  a  standard  appeal  on  a  band A  basis  and  usual  disbursements.    The  Ministry  of 
Business, Innovation and Employment must pay Messrs Fang and Dong together one 
set of costs for a standard appeal on a band A basis and usual disbursements.
