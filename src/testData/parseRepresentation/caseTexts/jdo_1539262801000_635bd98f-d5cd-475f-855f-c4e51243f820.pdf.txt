[1] S appeals against a Family Court decision ordering the return of her two
children to Australia where their father, P, resides.
[2] S was formerly in a relationship with P, the respondent. They lived together in
Western Australia with their two children (now aged four and eight). After negative
publicity relating to P's business practices, the parties agreed the mother should take
the children temporarily to New Zealand, to avoid the impact of public scrutiny. No
definitive end-point was agreed, but the strong expectation was the children would be
returned after the end of the 2017, and in time for commencement of the 2018 school
year.
