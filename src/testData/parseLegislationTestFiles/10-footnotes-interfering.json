	"caseText": "[2] Section 17 of the Insolvency Act 2006 provides that a debtor commits an act of bankruptcy in certain circumstances. Further, and of relevance to the present case, it must be shown that the debtor has not, within 10 working days of service of the notice, complied with it or satisfied the Court that he or she has a cross claim against the creditor.1 A cross claim means a counterclaim set-off or cross demand that is equal to or greater than the judgment debt or the amount that the debtor has been ordered to pay, and which the debtor could not use as a defence in the action or proceedings in which the judgment or the order was obtained.2\n\n[3] The judgment arose from proceedings filed by Ms Tao in relation to issues arising in the operation of the Body Corporate of an apartment complex in New Lynn, Auckland. The respondents are, respectively, the Body Corporate secretary, the Body Corporate chairperson, and the Body Corporate itself, constituted under the Unit Titles Act 2010.\n\n[4] In her application Ms Tao raises a number of grounds on which she says the Court should set the bankruptcy notice aside. First, Ms Tao says that as her action in bringing the original proceeding was directed at assisting with overall Body Corporate management issues, she is entitled to an indemnity from the Body Corporate in relation to her costs.\n1 Section 17(1)(d)(ii). 2 Section 17(7).\n\nSecondly, Ms Tao says that she has filed claims in the District Court and a complaint against the Body Corporate with the Human Rights Commissioner, which is to be decided by the Human Rights Review Tribunal. Section 18\n\n[5] After her exclusion from SkyCity, Ms Xiao discussed her options with Ms Sun, who told her that one option was for Ms Xiao to repay the $70,000 in one go so that they did not get into trouble. Another option was to pay weekly interest until Ms Xiao had repaid all the principal amounts. Ms Sun again told her that if the interest was not paid, then they would both be in trouble as the people associated with the lender friend had 'very powerful backgrounds'.\n\n[6] Ms Xiao said she thought about approaching her parents for the $70,000 but she said it would have been quite daunting to tell them. She said the outcome of the discussion with Ms Sun was that she could only get the necessary amount of money by winning at the casino. Ms Xiao therefore agreed with Ms Sun's other proposal.3 \n\n3 See Gambling Act 2003, s 310.",
