Counsel for the defendant, Mr Grove, in his closing submissions referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in PAE (New Zealand) Ltd v Brosnahan8 and acknowledged that, in that case, Harrison J delivering the judgment for the Court, had observed that due to s 4(1) of the Contractual Remedies Act 1979, entire agreement clauses are neither absolute nor conclusive, and the courts have a wide discretion to refuse to uphold them where it is not \"fair and reasonable that the provision should be conclusive\".",
